    "description": "This is an audio version of the Wikipedia Article:\r\nFrancis Pangilinan\r\n\r\nListening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading. Written\r\nlanguage only began at around 3200 BC, but spoken language has existed long ago.\r\n\r\nLearning by listening is a great way to:\r\n- increases imagination and understanding\r\n- improves your listening skills\r\n- improves your own spoken accent\r\n- learn while on the move\r\n- reduce eye strain\r\n\r\nNow learn the vast amount of general knowledge available on Wikipedia through\r\naudio (audio article). You could even learn subconsciously by playing the audio\r\nwhile you are sleeping! If you are planning to listen a lot, you could try using\r\na bone conduction headphone, or a standard speaker instead of an earphone.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find other Wikipedia audio articles too at:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCuKfABj2eGyjH3ntPxp4YeQ\r\n\r\nIn case you don't find one that you were looking for, put a comment.\r\nThis video uses Google TTS en-US-Standard-D voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n=======\r\nFrancis Pancratius \"Kiko\" Nepomuceno Pangilinan (Tagalog: [pa\u014b\u026a\u02c8l\u026an\u0250n]; born August 24, 1963) is a Filipino lawyer and politician who serves a Senator of the Philippines since 2016, having previously served from 2001 to 2013. Pangilinan\u2019s political life began as a student activist in 1985, on the eve of the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolt. In the Senate, he served as Senate Majority Leader from 2004 to 2008. In May 2014, Pangilinan was appointed Presidential Assistant for Food Security and Agricultural Modernization by President Benigno Aquino III. Pangilinan ran for senator again in 2016 under the Liberal Party of the Philippines, placing 9th out of 12 winning candidates. [1] He is now the new president of the party.",

The following year, local scenes were shot on film for the first time by a Spaniard, Antonio Ramos, using the Lumiere Cinematograph. Early filmmakers and producers in the country were mostly wealthy enterprising foreigners and expatriates, but by September 12, 1919, a silent feature film broke the grounds for Filipino filmmakers. Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden), a movie based on a popular musical play, was the first movie made and shown by Filipino filmmaker Jos\u00e9 Nepomuceno. Dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines.Even with the problems currently facing motion pictures around the world, movies are still considered as one of the popular forms of entertainment among the Filipino people, directly employing some 260,000 Filipinos and generating around \u20b12 billion revenues annually.The Film Academy of the Philippines established its own national film archive in October 2011. Furthermore, their annually held Luna Awards honor the outstanding Filipino films as voted by their own peers. Meanwhile, the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino hands out the Gawad Urian Awards, which is well known due to its credible choices of winners. Currently, Box Office Mojo compiles box office performance for local and foreign films in the country.\nImmediately after Liberation, Director Consuelo Ateng Padilla Osorio directed \u201cBakya Mo Neneng\u201d for Premiere Productions which was then unsurpassed for having been shown for 26 days with an averagetake of not less than P10,000 a day when orchestra tickets were at P1.20 only. \nThis still is the first Filipino Film shown also after WWII in Malaca\u00f1ang palace, as it was requested by the country's first lady then, Mrs. Trinidad de Leon-Roxas.",

Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.Modernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to \"Make it new!\" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal (or pantonal) and twelve-tone music, divisionist painting and abstract art, all had precursors in the 19th century.\nA notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc. Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody.Some commentators define modernism as a mode of thinking\u2014one or more philosophically defined characteristics, like self-consciousness or self-reference, that run across all the novelties in the arts and the disciplines. More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology. From this perspective, modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' progress, and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in the First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from Friedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) to Samuel Beckett (1906\u20131989).While some scholars see modernism continuing into the twenty first century, others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism. Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions.",
