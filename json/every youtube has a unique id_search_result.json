    "description": "Cavetown's \"Boys Will Be Bugs\" from the album Comet, part two of five in Cavetown's Animal Kingdom collaboration series.\n\u00a9 2018 Cavetown\n\nTypically Comet moths aren't able to eat or drink, and die within just a few days, but Animal Kingdom's Comet is different.\nOn Venus Comet moths live full lives, but our Comet became trapped in a meteor when it swept through Venus' atmosphere and hurtled towards earth. Landing in a forest near a city, Comet ventured into the streets to find anything she could drink to stay alive in this new realm. \nStrangely she was drawn exclusively to strawberry soda, and she would fly into vending machines to steal sips. \nShe has now settled into the forest, where she has assumed a motherly role to the animals there, diffusing tensions with her gentle manner and ensuring everyone is comfortable and happy. She's also the only one in the group who can read and understand human language from her experiences in the city, so this comes in handy whenever the animals need to venture into the urban unknown. \n\nCharacter design by Emerson Dellaero\nCharacter concept by Robin Skinner\n\niTunes\/Apple Music ~ https:\/\/apple.co\/2S5Kr9z\nSpotify ~ https:\/\/spoti.fi\/2QYpRYj\nBandcamp ~ https:\/\/cavetown.bandcamp.com\/\nAmazon MP3 ~ https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Qs7FdF\nGoogle Play ~ http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ru52cn\n\nI'm a dumb teen boy\nI eat sticks and rocks and mud\nI dont care about the government\nand I really need a hug\nI feel stupid (stupid) ugly (ugly)\nPretend it doesnt bother me\nI'm not very strong but\nI'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs\n\nIt's getting cold down here underneath the weather\nI skipped class to sit with you\nI really like your spotty sweater if\nladybugs are girls\nHow do you make kids together\nWhat's it like in a female world\nI bet it's just so much better\n\nI just turned fourteen\nand I think this year I'm gonna be mean\nDon't mess with me I\u2019m a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me cause I wont reply, I wanna make u cry\nAin't that how its s\u2019posed to be?

    "description": "The hardest problem with software is distribution. App developers often spend more on distribution than they earn back. This problem is solved by the web platform, however web apps have historically been less capable than native apps. With the advent of PWAs, web apps have become just as capable as native, supporting features such as push notifications and Add to Homescreen, without giving up the reach of the web.\n\nProgressive Web Apps combine the best of the native applications and the Web. This session outlines the business case, and gives an overview of PWA features.\n\nFull playlist:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIB2xHBZ7opgc2Mv009X87Hh",
