    "description": "Tired of having your videos blocked by copyright claims by Warner Music Group (WMG)? This video describes how to dispute the copyright claim and have videos restored that are blocked by YouTube's automated Content ID system. It also provides a basic introduction to the principles of \"fair use\" and describes how to tell if your video qualifies for this exception to copyright law, even if you do use some copyrighted material in your video. To learn more, please visit http:\/\/fairusetube.org\n\nAfter being frequently asked how I managed to keep my videos from being blocked by copyright claims by Warner Music Group, I decided to start a website devoted to describing how to deal with copyright problems on YouTube and similar user generated video sites - http:\/\/fairusetube.org. This video marks the official launch of that site, which provides a detailed Guide to YouTube Copyright Removals, instructions for disputing copyright claims on YouTube and other user generated video sites, and links to valuable resources for learning about copyright and fair use law online.\n\nNOTE: This video only describes the process for disputing videos block by YouTube's automated Content ID system. For videos that are blocked by DMCA takedown notices, you have to file a DMCA counter-notification to get the video restored.\n\nThis video is not legal advice and is no substitute for consulting a qualified attorney.\n\nHere is the fair use rationale I used if you want to cut and paste it: \"This video is fair use under U.S. copyright law because it is (1) noncommercial (2) transformative in nature, and (3) does not compete with the original work or have any negative effect on its market.\"\n\nSearch terms:\ncontent id matches\ndispute movie claim\nyoutube dispute\nhow to dispute form\ndispute copyright\nhow to keep my video from not being blocked by y\nchannel id tutorial\ndisputiing copyright\nofficial music video\nmusic\nwarner copyright\nyoutube video blocked dispute form\nyoutube content id\nremix blocked by copyright\nhow to deal with copyright dispute\ncontent id\ndarklordofdebate\nyoutube invalid on playlist edit\n\"copyright dispute\"\nwhat is content id matches\nthe content id matched\nyoutube content id matches\nhow to wmg\nhow to include copyrighted music in your video\nwarner music group",

    "description": "Cavetown's \"Boys Will Be Bugs\" from the album Comet, part two of five in Cavetown's Animal Kingdom collaboration series.\n\u00a9 2018 Cavetown\n\nTypically Comet moths aren't able to eat or drink, and die within just a few days, but Animal Kingdom's Comet is different.\nOn Venus Comet moths live full lives, but our Comet became trapped in a meteor when it swept through Venus' atmosphere and hurtled towards earth. Landing in a forest near a city, Comet ventured into the streets to find anything she could drink to stay alive in this new realm. \nStrangely she was drawn exclusively to strawberry soda, and she would fly into vending machines to steal sips. \nShe has now settled into the forest, where she has assumed a motherly role to the animals there, diffusing tensions with her gentle manner and ensuring everyone is comfortable and happy. She's also the only one in the group who can read and understand human language from her experiences in the city, so this comes in handy whenever the animals need to venture into the urban unknown. \n\nCharacter design by Emerson Dellaero\nCharacter concept by Robin Skinner\n\niTunes\/Apple Music ~ https:\/\/apple.co\/2S5Kr9z\nSpotify ~ https:\/\/spoti.fi\/2QYpRYj\nBandcamp ~ https:\/\/cavetown.bandcamp.com\/\nAmazon MP3 ~ https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Qs7FdF\nGoogle Play ~ http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ru52cn\n\nI'm a dumb teen boy\nI eat sticks and rocks and mud\nI dont care about the government\nand I really need a hug\nI feel stupid (stupid) ugly (ugly)\nPretend it doesnt bother me\nI'm not very strong but\nI'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs\n\nIt's getting cold down here underneath the weather\nI skipped class to sit with you\nI really like your spotty sweater if\nladybugs are girls\nHow do you make kids together\nWhat's it like in a female world\nI bet it's just so much better\n\nI just turned fourteen\nand I think this year I'm gonna be mean\nDon't mess with me I\u2019m a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me cause I wont reply, I wanna make u cry\nAin't that how its s\u2019posed to be?
