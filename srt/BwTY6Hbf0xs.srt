what I'm doing with my makeups so I'm

66
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,780
kind of just doing this as I go along

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,250
after them also see you guys in my skin

68
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,960
so you can kind of see how all the

69
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,820
colors look it might not show up as good

70
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,680
as in my eyes because oh my eyes I'm

71
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,060
gonna use primer and all that but that

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,920
way you guys can still kind of see how

73
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,900
it looks and yes okay i'm going to try

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,220
some of the colors now so the greatest

75
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,540
thing that i'm going to do before i

76
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,810
actually even put any of these

77
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,790
eyeshadows on i'm going to use my Urban

78
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,260
Decay primer potion so that way the

79
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,260
colors should appear a lot better

80
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,550
exactly sure what colors I was going to

81
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,140
use like I said I think that first I'm

82
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,480
going to take this shade Clementine

83
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,400
which is kind of like this for appt

84
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,340
shape and i'm going to try putting that

85
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,430
kind of like just in the inner corner of

86
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,600
my eye and just like putting that kind

87
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,600
of like a little bit throughout their

88
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,519
ok so that's that I just put that on a

89
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,230
little bit and I really really like this

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,060
color I feel like it's really pretty

91
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,459
it's a really nice kind of like peachy

92
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,260
shade so I think it's really cool then

93
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,480
kind of like on the Rex would i think

94
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,849
i'm going to try meow which is a

95
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,920
personal change think that name is so to

96
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,260
you because it's like a cat and cast

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,060
your office like what I hear me out it

98
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,819
just makes me want to like put on my cat

99
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:04,299
headphones and I'm going to put that on

100
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:07,269
my I now ok so that is that shade right

101
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,940
there on my iPad so I really like this

102
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,889
shade I think it's really nice really

103
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,599
kind of like my last shade of purple and

104
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:15,069
I feel like it goes really good with

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,049
like the teachers gate I feel like they

106
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,539
blended well like really well together

107
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,360
so I really like how they blend you in

108
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,370
easley so I think now unlike the crease

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,229
kind of part of my eye I'm going to use

110
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:38,740
the darker purple which is called soup

111
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:41,380
and see how that works so that's the

112
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,660
darker purple also like blended into my

113
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,580
eyes I feel like it's super super nice

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,530
it blends really really well at the

115
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,389
other colors I just realized that you're

116
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,599
probably doing the other I at the same

117
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,090
time so ok I'm going to like to but I

118
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:58,139
already did to the side to the other I

119
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,139
really quick

120
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,909
you

121
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:19,529
[Music]

122
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,370
alright so now both I feel like in the

123
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,140
same place i also just took a blending

124
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,000
brush to blend the colors together a

125
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,530
little bit more and the next thing i'm

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,930
going to do is how did you like the

127
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,880
highlights above my eye and I'm going to

128
00:05:49,930 --> 00:06:05,230
try the white shade which is coughs all

129
00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:06,670
like what I need up ok so that's the way

130
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,470
to eat I feel like it's a really really

131
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,000
nice white face would be like a white

132
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,070
eyeshadow I feel like it works really

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,680
good now I'm going to go under my eyes

134
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,000
and not sure exactly what I want to do

135
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,060
is like I said I'm kind of just like

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,650
doing this as I go along I really want

137
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,560
to try to blue shade though which is

138
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,020
zoom right there so i think i'm going to

139
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:53,140
try that underneath my eyes she's like a

140
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:56,170
little brush to do not alright so now i

141
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,820
have two blue underneath my eyes I deal

142
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,860
with the blue works really really good

143
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,570
it's a really really nice really bright

144
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,550
kind of blue I really like blue eye

145
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,200
shadow so definitely one of my favorite

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,180
colors that I've tried but now this is a

147
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,530
really like part of the palace but I

148
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,600
hope they're just going to do eyeliner

149
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,460
and mascara real quick because I always

150
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,770
like to have that with my eye makeup and

151
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,420
i'll show you guys how needs actually

152
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,720
look in my skin so you can see all the

153
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,720
colors

154
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,529
[Music]

155
00:07:34,170 --> 00:08:06,970
[Music]

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,169
[Music]

157
00:08:36,960 --> 00:09:03,360
I thought well those are my eyes

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:19,440
finished so this is how they came out

159
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:21,450
found them done so i really really love

160
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
the colors in this palette and I feel

161
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,110
like super awesome palette and also i'm

162
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,540
going to show you guys just kind of had

163
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,820
a look on my skin so that way you can

164
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,500
see all the colors and also the colors

165
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,910
that i didn't use today cuz there's a

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,260
couple that i didn't use because i think

167
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,200
it would be kind of hard foods like

168
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,330
eight colors of my eyes like in one go

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,920
but yeah i'm going to try to fit if you

170
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,230
guys just like on my skin a little bit

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,030
so the internet colors I actually think

172
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,940
they showed us really really well on my

173
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:51,450
arm which is cool so that's them all

174
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,720
actually in order well backwards order

175
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,370
huh and yeah they super nice and I

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,890
really like how all the colors are like

177
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,930
a very nice and pastel looking but they

178
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,270
also a really bright and really show up

179
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,950
and see really pretty so I like them a

180
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:11,040
lot they're really cool here show you

181
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:13,290
closer up to 15 your arm is actually

182
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,350
really hard to get all the colors to

183
