1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Robert's got a quick hand

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,800
He will look around the room

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,020
He won't tell you his plan

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,400
He's got a rolled cigarette

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,400
Hanging out his mouth

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
He's a cowboy kid. Yeah!

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,200
He found a six-shooter gun

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,200
In his dad's closet, Yeh!

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
In the box of fun things

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,800
And I don't even know what...

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,640
But he's coming for you

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Yeah, he's coming for you!

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,100
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,380
You better run, better run

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,280
Outrun my gun

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,540
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,620
You better run, better run

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,760
Faster than my bullet!

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,100
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
You better run, better run

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,100
Outrun my gun

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,660
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

23
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,900
You better run, better run

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Faster than my bullet!

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,100
Daddy works a long day

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,060
He'll be coming home late

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Yeah, he's coming home late

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,040
Yeah, and he's bringing me a surprise!

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,420
'Cause dinner is in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,140
I've waited for a long time

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
Yeah, the sleight of my hand

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Is now a quick-pull trigger

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,860
I reason with my cigarette

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Then say, "your hair on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah?"

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,220
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,220
You better run, better run

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Outrun my gun

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,580
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,920
