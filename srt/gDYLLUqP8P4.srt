here because it does all come from Asia

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,840

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,309

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,750

now they listed as a buzz online but

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,340
it's kind of like a sweater whilst kind

40
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,470
of thing I guess I don't know and these

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,810
Kevin a lot of different colors I got it

42
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,610
in this really pretty pink shade I

43
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,710
thought it was a really cute color are

44
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,930
pretty very material they're actually

45
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,729
super super soft they're pretty warm too

46
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,619
which i like about that since I get

47
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,930
cooled a lot I'm also wearing a skirt

48
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,030
that is actually also from this site I

49
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,520
thought this was a very very cute skirt

50
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,079
so the boat was actually a pin on Bo so

51
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,030
you can really put it wherever you want

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,770
you could put them in the back if you

53
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,030
prefer to have it and back of the skirt

54
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,130
because yeah it has this design on it

55
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,719
throughout it or if you want to you can

56
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,369
do it i did and just kind of put it on

57
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,710
the front because i thought it looks

58
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,590
good

59
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,080
so that's where I put it so the next

60
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,600
skirt is a blue skirt it's just kind of

61
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,209
like a pleated skirt and then yeah I

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,690
just I'm just super cute let's get this

63
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,940
little button right here so yeah and

64
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,560
there's a zipper on the side basically

65
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,150
everything on this site is mostly like

66
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,620
side zippers at least like from what I

67
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,330
ordered I think so this is another one

68
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,190
that I got thought it was really cute

69
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,140
it's just a black skirt and then it's

70
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,940
kind of like a layer kind of skirt I

71
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,250
guess you could say because that over it

72
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,959
has this kind of like additional player

73
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,910
that's black and it's just kind of like

74
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,200
a clear kind of like sheer black and

75
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,030
yeah so that's the skirt I actually post

76
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,430
a picture on Twitter of his yesterday

77
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,370
committing it's super super cute so this

78
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,700
is basically a jacket like the reason

79
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,390
that I love this so much is that it had

80
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,980
these adorable bunny ears huh yeah I

81
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,720
thought that was so cute like I

82
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,510
especially like lots of the funny years

83
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,840
so yeah thought they was super super

84
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,760
adorable these are little like paw

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,110
prints gloves all fingerless which is

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,560
perfect is that way when I'm using my

87
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,900
phone I still can use it because my

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,610
gloves are fingerless the red jacket

89
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,680
it's really good for like in the Windsor

90
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,440
when you're cold or things like that so

91
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,760
yes so that's that's this jacket and yet

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,730
as you can see it's just kind of like a

93
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,959
foyer to kind of jacket so just kind of

94
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,600
like pops out there and yeah this is

95
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,269
this they are like a white nice talk

96
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,780
with these little like black stripes

97
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:37,900
going on the top throughout them so yeah

98
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,410
I got these for an awesome pair of socks

99
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,660
I put this skirt back on because I

100
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,850
realized i forgot to show you guys the

101
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,320
actual top that goes with it because it

102
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,660
goes to the top that is also really

103
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,330
really

104
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,650
similar to the anime school drop it so I

105
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,090
have the only thing that's like

106
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,180
different with it is it's like a bit of

107
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,180
a longer top right there so yeah also on

108
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,130
the top it has this little like fabric

109
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,310
piece instead of just kind of like a

110
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,500
solid color it has this really cute like

111
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:12,260
pattern it's like flowers on it and all

112
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:15,260
of that so I got another pair of

113
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,000
over-the-knee socks and this is another

114
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,680
pair of over knee socks that are in pink

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,989
these are super cute because they also

116
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,120
have these little bows on them so you

117
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,940
can just kind of tie I'm not sure if I

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,460
tied it in the right place like on this

119
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,340
one I was kind of having some trouble

120
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,410
like figuring out we are the little

121
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,820
string thing goes into I feel like I can

122
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,130
never have too many pairs of these

123
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,080
software like you so much this pair i

124
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,340
know that i do have some tied right I

125
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,070
think when the other ones i may have

126
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,890
like tie the bow on the wrong side cuz

127
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,060
oh yeah on these bows you kind of like

128
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,740
strengthen through these little holes

129
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,780
you kind of need to go like in and out

130
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,790
of bowls up but yeah I think they were

131
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,680
so cute with the ribbon and I really

132
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,230
liked this power it's just kind of like

133
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,910
a red head of maroon kind of color

134
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,980
though the next shirt is this super

135
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,440

136
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,510

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,490

138
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,620

that is my cat shirt and then i'll stay

141
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,230
i got these which these actually look

142
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:21,560
like a pair of knee socks or overturning

143
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,350
socks but these are actually not so

144
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,450

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,880
this pink dress is really really cute

184
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,580
it's just kind of like this cool kind of

185
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,590
like sheer material throughout it then

186
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,090
they said I let you do with it is on the

187
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,280
side it just kind of came with this

188
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,740
little tie I don't know if I really did

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,290
like the best job tying it right now so

190
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,060
it looks kind of weird in some sections

191
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,729
and that's probably why so sorry about

192
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,720
that we gotta use kind of tired and then

193
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:30,220
makes it fit really good and yeah that's

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:32,110
this dress this is a white shirt that I

195
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,729
got from this site I just really like

196
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,410
specified sure a lot I thought it was a

197
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:38,080
really really cool shirt so this shirt

198
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,090
has a collar on the top as you can see I

199
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,330
kind of threw here it just kind of has

200
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,970
all these lines and then yeah so that's

201
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,789
the shirt it also came with this black

202
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,100
little ribbon thing but I'm honestly not

203
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:52,870
sure exactly it's just how it's supposed

204
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,520
to be worn I'm probably actually going

205
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,830
to check the vector in the website from

206
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,150
when I ordered it and see if I am

207
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,310
wearing your right cuz I'm not really

208
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,289
sure if you are so as to where it like

209
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,729
the way I have on right now I'd remember

210
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,770
so tie it in a bow or just kind of like

211
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,650
tie it like that kinda or just us to

212
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,169
where it is like around your waist high

213
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,729
early don't know but yeah I really like

214
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:19,630

225
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,470

226
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:48,440
supposed to be some kind of like

227
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,300

228
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,209

229
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,120
ears it also has a tail in the back and

230
00:08:53,209 --> 00:09:03,260
I love that about this I think it's so

231
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:05,420
cute so the next thing that I want to

232
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,829
show you guys is this light dress I

233
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,980
thought this is a really really pretty

234
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:12,260
white dress it's kind of like a dress

235
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,320

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:19,370
the collar it has all these pretty

237
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,740
jewels so that's there I'll so this bow

238
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,079
that actually is on the dress actually

239
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,240
comes separately I think it came with

240
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,520
the dress but actually is kind of like

241
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,660
put that on with it and then it makes it

242
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,000
look a lot better because it definitely

243
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,300
makes it like it better and all of that

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,370
so yes just like a white dress with a

245
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:42,649
black bow the next thing is this kind of

246
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,540
bluish green little shirt kind of thing

247
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,510
and yeah I said this was super super

248
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,579
cute pretty loose and but it's kind of

249
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,290
meant to be like that and it's really

250
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,579
really soft like that's something that I

251
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,010
really like about this website is

252
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:57,170
everything was just super soft and cute

253
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:03,070
it has all these little flowers on it

254
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,070
throughout it so yeah that's the shirt

255
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,040

256
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,070
you guys it is like super super soft

257
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,350
it's like this nice free super super

258
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,400
soft material coolest thing about this

259
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,140
it has ears up so yay these are sea

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,840
very cute I'm not sure this supposed to

261
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,660
be like cat ears or wolf ears or what

262
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,770
exactly but basically anything with

263
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,960
animal ears I almost always loved it so

264
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,270
yeah I looked at about this that it had

265
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,780
these years and it also just has these

266
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,730
little pig strings here I'm guessing

267
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,010
these are two just kind of to tie it or

268
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,300
something I mean it has the buttons to

269
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,720
you but I guess if he will still want to

270
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:55,580
tie it then I don't know but yeah these

271
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:57,290
are here this is another way dress that

272
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,330
I got from this site I just thought this

273
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,690
was a really cute white dress it's just

274
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,340
kind of a white dress with some layers I

275
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,260
guess if you want to call it that I

276
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,570
don't really know exactly what you call

277
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,400
it when there's like a layer of a dress

278
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,900
but that's just what I'm going to call

279
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:17,210
it back think it lowers a little bit and

280
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,390
then yeah this is just a white dress

281
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,190
that I thought was really cute when I

282
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,080
saw this pink skirt on the site I

283
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,430
thought it was super super cute I really

284
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,200
wanted to get it I really like these

285
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,480
kind of skirts and dresses and things

286
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
like that really kind of just like filed

287
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,160
a little bit so then right there there's

288
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,100
a bow and I'm not really sure honestly

289
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,010
if this bow is supposed to go in the

290
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,020
front or the back um it doesn't really

291
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,520
have like a tag on it like how a lot of

292
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,040
clothes have so you kind of know what

293
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,710
site it goes on I really think it really

294
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,330
can go on wherever you want it to go I

295
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,290
just kind of liked it with the bow in

296
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,980
the front so that's why I'm

297
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:59,380
to go in the front right now this is

298
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,269
another pair of tights I got this is

299
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,370
just basically a black pair of tights

300
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,110
but they're super super cute because

301
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,350
they have these little fuzz on them with

302
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,209
a little jewel all right there and then

303
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,699
on the top they kind of turned a bit

304
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:15,069
more sheer this is another pair of socks

305
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:17,230
that I thought and these are black and

306
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,779
pink striped socks I think that these

307
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,790
goes super super well with this skirt or

308
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,170
probably look a lot of stuff that I

309
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,120
ordered I just really like the

310
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,130
combination of black and pink I feel

311
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,790
like those two colors look really good

312
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:36,339
together so yeah I really like these

313
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,660
socks lot so I really like garters even

314
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,339
though I don't have too many I've always

315
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,899
thought they were really cool so when I

316
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,550
saw this when I was like ah this is the

317
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,139
coolest that I've ever seen past this

318
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,139
hurts here which I thought was super

319
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:49,990
cute and then all throughout it it is

320
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,600
super super studded I love studs I think

321
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,959
studs are awesome so yeah that's my

322
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,959
girder

323
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,000
[Music]

324
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,279
this one might be kind of a weird thing

325
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,500
to stubbing you guys but for some reason

326
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,769
for a really really long time I've

327
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,810
wanted an umbrella not really for

328
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,120
probably the reason that most people

329
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,190
want an umbrella to like you know stay

330
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,829
dry in the rain but more like a fashion

331
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,750
kind of umbrella just because for the

332
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:23,910
sake of the looking cool pretty much so

333
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,440
yeah I ordered an umbrella it actually

334
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,850
even came with a little umbrella case

335
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,829
it's really pretty even if it wasn't

336
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,899
raining I think I think it's kind of

337
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:33,449
just like a cool fashion kind of

338
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,550
umbrella the purple umbrella and then

339
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:37,529
the inside is really really awesome it's

340
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,380
actually kind of like a galaxy umbrella

341
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,300
not really like the galaxy that everyone

342
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,160
is obsessed with I like that galaxy two

343
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,339
that I do it I like like a lot of

344
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,649
galaxies stuff is cool but um it's kind

345
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:52,440
of like a bunch of stars and it's like a

346
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:54,709
nice guy there's a moon there's just a

347
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,880
bunch of stars throughout the inside so

348
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,279
yeah I thought it was a really really

349
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,470
cool umbrella next thing is this black

350
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,260
skirt here this is actually technically

351
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,319
escorts because it has shorts well this

352
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,319
but yeah this is just a cute black skirt

353
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,370

the next thing is really really cute you

355
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,560

00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:25,319
it is a yellow hoodie but it's not just

357
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:27,870
