00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,760
hey guys justine and today we're

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,060
checking out one of the brand new

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,189
cameras by DJI this is the Osmo pocket

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,349
and this thing is so tiny and is so

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,210
awesome I cannot wait to unbox it

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,469
spoiler alert I actually already opened

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,389
it up to look at it because I couldn't

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,220
wait to film the video I try to package

9
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,170
it up very nicely to make it look like I

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,270
didn't open it just keep that in mind

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,430
you may be familiar with DJI they have

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,990
the Osmo Mobile's which you can put your

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,400
phones in there also famous for their

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,109
steady camera line which are the Ronin

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,970
and the new roller desks which I also

16
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,679
reviewed previously on my channel and I

17
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,360
love the road and I just shot a really

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,100
fun video with it and while I absolutely

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
love the Ronin and the shots that you

20
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,390
can get with it it's heavy it's big it's

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,610
not something that is compact like this

22
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,649
so I am super excited to check this out

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,420
this is also 4k you can shoot at 60

24
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,820
frames a second it connects directly to

25
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,399
your phone this camera looks very

26
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,870
similar to what is on one of the Mavic

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,699
drones it's one of the things that I

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,010
think is so important about filmmaking

29
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,750
or just taking photos or anything in

30
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,070
general is if there is something that is

31
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,539
small and compact that you can always

32
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,940
have with you that's what's most

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,500
important I can't lug around my ronin at

34
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,200
all times but this is something that I

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,960
actually could keep in my pocket great

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,100
name guys great names alright let's open

37
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,320
this up I'm gonna use one of my new

38
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,390
knives that I got the brand is James

39
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,090
they're based out of Portland I believe

40
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,119
comes with this cute little cloth even

41
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,229
come in this nice little wooden box

42
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,549
alright James are you ready for your

43
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,320
first cut also something that's cool is

44
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,479
on the box it says right here this is so

45
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,030
cool it says first cut this will be my

46
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:36,479
first cut awesome a mobile bow like

47
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,250
I sliced through the box actually I

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,930
didn't just take a peek in here so I

49
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,119
didn't completely ruin it this is the

50
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,890
little case and here is the camera

51
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,930
itself it's crazy because it's really

52
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,490
small but it has a significant way to it

53
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,990
like it's not heavy but it just feels

54
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,729
substantial so it doesn't feel like

55
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,350
you're not holding anything that's

56
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,330
probably because of the battery so with

57
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,159
a one-hour charge you can reach a 90

58
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,619
percent battery level you can shoot for

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,640
two hours on 4k and 140 minutes if

60
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,869
you're shooting in 1080p

61
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,610
there's also have some intelligent

62
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,950
features which we're very used to with

63
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,470
DJI products like active track face

64
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,649
track panorama time lapse motion lapse

65
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,959
HDR photos also has an LCD there's a

66
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,940
micro SD card slot you've got some

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,170
buttons to record and select there's a

68
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,310
little adapter that you can put here

69
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,769
depending upon what type of phone you

70
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,019
have so if you have a USBC micro USB or

71
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:25,769
a lightning that is inside of here so I

72
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:29,130
should probably open this up so that was

73
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:32,519
probably the thing that I need it it was

74
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,480
so the slides in just like so they even

75
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,610
thought of everything you're gonna keep

76
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,600
your adapter on that's nice so another

77
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,450
thing that's interesting is this now

78
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,560
uses an all new app it's called DJI MIMO

79
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:48,120
so let's turn this on the Westie card hi

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,130
oh my gosh this is so small basically

81
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,140
the drone camera but on a gimbal this is

82
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,000
also touchscreen a lot of things that I

83
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,340
can do on here so I'm gonna plug this

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,260
into my phone this is crazy

85
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,019
it just it just turned on it just works

86
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,090
now that we've unboxed let's take it out

87
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,560
and test it out oh this is gonna be so

88
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,350
fun you should probably get an SD card

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,209
today we're off on adventure we're in

90
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,340
Big Bear and right now you may see

91
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,780
behind me we have a Ford Raptor for the

92
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,640
week now we're taking this thing into

93
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,650
the desert but first got to get some

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,770
coffee

95
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,820
[Applause]

96
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:23,100
[Music]

97
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,090
time to test out the Osmo pocket this

98
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,590
thing's so cool

99
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,490
the first thing once out is a panel

100
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,990
which is kind of cool because usually

101
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,940
when you're doing a piano you have to

102
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,800
move the camera around but you don't you

103
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,350
just hit the panel button the gimbal

104
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,300
adjusts itself and it moves and gets you

105
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,130
a perfect panel shot also I test out

106
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,300
shooting 60 frames a second so let's see

107
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:56,700
what that looks like

108
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:56,700
[Music]

109
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:08,070
[Music]

110
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,690
so this will shoot 4k 30 frames and 60

111
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,370
frames a second but I love shooting in

112
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,990
60 frames because it does look really

113
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,580
smooth and then you can slow that down

114
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,140
50 percent and then you can get some

115
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,640
nice slow-mo footage and it'll still be

116
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,920
in 4k I'm into it

117
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,209
are you into a dad I'm very into it it's

118
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,340
really great as the audio is actually

119
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,640
pretty good too and as you can see we

120
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,360
got that Raptor in the background this

121
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,619
thing is so much fun to drive

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,619
[Music]

123
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,470
[Music]

124
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,060
[Applause]

125
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,139
so I'm not passing out the 30 frames a

126
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,020
second I'm gonna clean up this little

127
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,610
rock here and then I want to try out the

128
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,880
time-lapse and see what that looks like

129
00:04:51,610 --> 00:05:10,300
okay I flip the camera ready

130
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:11,770
flip okay I'm trying out the tracking

131
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,780
right now it's kind of cool because

132
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:20,069
it'll basically I move it tracks my face

133
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,069
yeah so here we are

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,199
it's good yeah

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,849
so that me yeah perfectly sir this I'm

136
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,289
an confuse it on that one I think you

137
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:56,699
maybe hit the gimbal limit I might oh no

138
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:58,319
it still has me oh my now I'm gonna give

139
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,580
you guys an example of the story modes

140
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,259
this is cool because it'll automatically

141
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,970
make you like this short little clip of

142
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,940
a movie it'll show you certain time

143
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,139
length so like 2.5 seconds 3.9 and then

144
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,759
you fill in those little blanks with

145
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,949
some shot it'll automatically cut those

146
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,640
clips into a little movie so let's write

147
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:17,609
off

148
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,609
[Music]

149
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,169
our little movement you're not so good

150
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,229
I'm saving it

151
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,229
I'm surprised yeah that's good cool

152
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:47,270
[Music]

153
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,650
I'm extremely impressed with this thing

154
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,240
and I honestly don't we're not really

155
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,340
home without it like the audio was good

156
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,430
the video quality is incredible the fact

157
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,740
that you can track yourself if you get

158
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,810
one of those little log mics that record

159
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,949
SD cards I know Jonathan always uses

160
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,539
those I'm have to ask him if those are

161
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:03,830
because they're really cool you could

162
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,349
basically be doing like a whole entire

163
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,400
shoot with this setup you also need

164
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,840
another phones that you could film the

165
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:16,610
other phones but that's a Justine

166
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:19,520
problem if time-lapse probably should

167
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,259
have done a smaller movement longer time

168
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,570
lapse because this is all we got it's

169
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,099
super short I mean it's it looks cool

170
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,360
there are so many possibilities for this

171
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,360
like I'm extremely excited

we're now officially pretty much of the

175
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,300
middle of nowhere we love any reception

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,810
you've also got the super 7 for you Mike

177
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,860
I mean this is so much more like I am so

178
00:07:51,810 --> 00:08:08,980
