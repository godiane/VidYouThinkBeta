1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
got my hands on an LG g5 let's jump in

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,470
and assess the build quality through a

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:14,639
series of relatively logical durability

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:15,870
tests this one is definitely unique the

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,789
battery has a little button near the

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,160
bottom that ejects the cartridge out of

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,689
the phone you can also detach the

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,850
battery from the base of the cartridge

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,500
just by pulling on it apparently you can

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,599
also add other toys to the end of the

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,680
phone as well like a camera module kind

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
of reminds me of those old-school

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,270
gameboy accessories the LG g5 has a

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,829
screen protector pre-installed so I'll

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,440
pull that off before we jump into the

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,450
good stuff I have a series of pics with

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,129
different tips on them and they allow me

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,649
to see where the hardness of the screen

19
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,719
falls on Mohs scale of hardness notice

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,730
how thin the glasses though you can see

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,680
the pressure of my pic against the LCD

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,050
it's probably good for the cellphone

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,930
weight and cost management but it does

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,730
not have a very quality feel to it nor

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,370
will it protect the LCD very well if

26
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,949
it's dropped the LG g5 has Gorilla Glass

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,019
4 so it doesn't scratch until level 6

28
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,180
and then a deeper scratch with the

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,970
seventh pick which is on par with other

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,590
smart phones these days the camera lens

31
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,330
is made of glass which is fantastic

32
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,400
considering they have more than the

33
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,439
usual amount of cameras back here one is

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,780
a normal camera and the other is a super

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,310
wide angle lens not as wide as a GoPro

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,990
but still wider than any other cell

37
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,939
phone either way it's protected with

38
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,890
glass and not plastic which is a good

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,840
thing the fingerprint scanner and power

40
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,210
buttons are made of plastic as well as

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,189
the back housing this is not a premium

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,810
filling phone by any means I tried

43
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,250
scratching up the fingerprint scanner to

44
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,229
see if it would still work after heavy

45
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,570
abuse and surprisingly it worked just

46
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,400
fine recognized my finger and would

47
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,040
unlock the phone I'd give that a thumbs

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,470
up for sure here's the burn test this is

49
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,659
another phone with an IPS LCD display

50
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,509
very similar to the iphone SE that i

51
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,610
tested earlier today the iphones pixels

52
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,880
turned off after about 16 seconds of

53
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,100
flame the LG g5 pixels turned off after

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,409
only three seconds then burned

55
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,149
permanently and left a white mark having

56
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,219
a thicker glass like the iphone and

57
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,590
samsung's would protect the LCD better

58
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,060
and give it a more premium feel you can

59
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,670
even see the pressure of my finger

60
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,210
against the LCD during normal use now

61
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,860
when I first got this phone I

62
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,450
for sure that the end cartridge would

63
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,790
snap off like a piece of chocolate

64
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,530
during the bin test you can see how

65
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,170
Wiggly it is with just my fingertips

66
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,480
with a full-on bend in progress the end

67
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,600
piece will flex in both directions like

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,670
a 680 dollar pez dispenser but amazingly

69
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,440
it does not snap off I don't know what

70
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,880
kind of black magic they used to secure

71
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,220
it in place but the phone still

72
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,250
functions one hundred percent and passes

73
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,900
the bin test this is my 19th smartphone

74
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,700
durability test hit that subscribe

75
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,830
