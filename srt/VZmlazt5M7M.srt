want to like mess with it too much so

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,379

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,300
since it's like Valentine's Day months

23
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,920
and stuff hi I would just do some kind

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,430
of like dating like the relationship

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
love kind of advice so yeah that's what

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,309
this video is going to be about I know

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
it haven't really been in too many

28
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,930
relationships other than was like Jack

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,210
Skellington but hey I'm going to like

30
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,340
give you guys some advice anyway and

31
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,870
like see how this goes I definitely one

32
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,549
thing that I would say it's really

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,439
really important like no matter who it

34
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,420
is that you're interested in or who it

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,830
is that you might be doing or someone

36
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,330
that you want to date or just like

37
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,850
whatever is that I think the thing that

38
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,439
is super super important is to always be

39
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,110
yourself and never feel like you have to

40
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,850
change yourself for anybody and I really

41
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,530
feel like that just applies to a lot of

42
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,810
things whether it's the way that you act

43
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,700
or the way that you look whatever I

44
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,680
really think it's important you guys to

45
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,479
remember that you guys are all very very

46
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,340
special people and you guys are all

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,470
super unique you might not like realize

48
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,939
that sometimes I know all the time the

49
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,770
world tries to bring people down

50
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,420
unfortunately you should never wish that

51
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,670
you or anyone else other than yourself

52
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,890
like there's only one of you and they'll

53
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,630
never be anyone who is exactly like you

54
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,579
so I think that's very important thing

55
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,290
to remember if somebody doesn't accept

56
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,240
you as you are whether it's like the way

57
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,549
that you look or something about your

58
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,259
personality or just like whatever then I

59
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,310
really feel like it's really important

60
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,350
for you guys to know that you should

61
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,420
never feel like you have 14 I mean

62
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,400
unless you're doing really bad things or

63
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,010
alert

64
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,560
upsetting people or doing things that

65
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,509
are actually legit bad to people that i

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,070
always think it is good to try some like

67
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,780
improve yourself and try to delete the

68
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,460
best version of yourself that you can be

69
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,230
I don't feel like it's really important

70
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,030
to be a good person and to try to make

71
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,190
people happy but don't ever feel like I

72
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,510
need to change who you are if you think

73
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,860
that you don't want to do to change

74
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,840
things about the way you look or

75
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,940
whatever because if you're like having

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,650
to be someone else that person's ever

77
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,690
you like or whatever even if they just

78
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,520
like you or whatever it would it really

79
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,650
be truly liking you because you want

80
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,690
somebody to truly love who you are for

81
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,160
the beautiful person that you are so I

82
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,470
think it's really important to remember

83
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,420
to be yourself and you're single right

84
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,910
now in Valentine's Day or just whatever

85
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,980
this remembers that's totally okay i

86
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,290
just think ill to to like it's okay

87
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,150
we're single together I just get my

88
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,040
relationships like on weed out but now

89
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,200
you now got rid of the proposals are you

90
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,150
so now we can't even get relationships

91
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,440
on there it's super depressing but I

92
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,090
just think it's really important to

93
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,370
remember the guys that even if like

94
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,680
you're single right now it really is

95
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,840
okay and you really don't need someone

96
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,670
your life to be happy I do lots of other

97
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,850
people too like whether it is like

98
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,830
friends or pets or whatever there's so

99
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,840
many like great people there for you to

100
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,190
love and people that love you so just

101
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,320
remember to even if you're single right

102
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,030
now they're on Valentine's Day it really

103
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,650
doesn't matter you're gone and think

104
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,570
it's really this day it's really about

105
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,940
that because you have felt so bad for

106
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,300
being single it's okay to be single and

107
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,390
single two so we are like single friends

108
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,130
but you are reading someone or if there

109
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,080
is someone that you're interested in or

110
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,640
really just two more people in general I

111
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,800
feel like this is very important thing

112
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,780
to do in life this is generally how do

113
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,550
we think it's very important in life to

114
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,170
show people that you care about them and

115
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,450
to tell them that you love them and just

116
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,400
to do nice things for people i joined is

117
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,350
just a super super important thing in

118
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,360
life like you can make people so happy

119
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,400
by doing nice things for them and just

120
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,260
like shooting people right and trying to

121
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,390
be a good person or instead you could

122
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,400
really bring people down by not being so

123
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,440
nice and saying some not-so-nice things

124
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,150
or

125
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,320
just like things like that in general so

126
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,150
I always feel like it's a really

127
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,280
important things we tried to be a nice

128
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,530
person and just to show people that you

129
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,730
do care about them and you tell people

130
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,650
that you loved it and this will

131
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,840
hopefully not be happening to anyone

132
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,730
like right now or anything but like if

133
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,170
that person wasn't see around win big

134
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,030
you know knew it at least feel really

135
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,500
good if you were to tell that person

136
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,120
right now that you love them and that

137
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,860
you care for them and that's why it's

138
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
really always important to show people

139
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,210
that and she's like express your love

140
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
for people and for things in your life

141
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,390
that you're grateful for i also just

142
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,800
think it's a really good thing in

143
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,870
general to just try to be a good

144
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,970
Christian life like I know a lot of

145
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,010
people on the internet really do not

146
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,470
like me and I am sorry to dispute but we

147
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,180
don't like me but I really always do try

148
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,740
to be a good Christian and to make

149
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,450
people happy I mean feel like that's a

150
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,100
good thing to you guys because that way

151
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,900
you'll be attracting people into your

152
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,880
life who are also trying to be positive

153
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,220
towards people and make people happy I

154
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,170
really feel like as people are just like

155
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,150
judging you being negative and not being

156
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,190
nice to you then those aren't any people

157
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,600
that you want in your life anyway so I

158
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,890
really feel like it's just important if

159
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,200
you try to be a good person to reach

160
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,850
everyone to be nice to people and that

161
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,150
way you'll attract people into your life

162
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,410
to actually like should be there it was

163
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,419
like the right people in your life

164
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,400
remember if there's lots of ways to meet

165
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,500
people and fast like even if you feel

166
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,480
really lonely right now there's tons of

167
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,310
people out there in the world and when I

168
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,050
asked for fighting chance or creating

169
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,400
you're just like whatever yeah I know

170
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,560
where it's a really big world up there

171
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,330
and there's so many great people out

172
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,220
there I really believe that everything

173
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,990
does happen for a reason and a lot of

174
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,580
the time to write people just like find

175
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,440
their way into your life like you just

176
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,450
have to see what happens and just try to

177
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,370
stay positive even one that's hard and

178
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,840
remember things can get better to let

179
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,280
the internet even though there's some

180
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,990
really not so nice people on the

181
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,289
internet there's so many great and nice

182
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,909
people on the internet

183
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,740

187
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,399
tons of great ways to meet people in the

188
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,110
world I'm not everything the people that

189
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,430

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,139
just want to be friends with or just

191
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,610
like whatever it I really think it's

192
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:06,319
cool like when people try to take

193
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,479
interesting things that that person is

194
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,099
interested in you guys could find common

195
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,689
and chest that you guys are both into

196
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:14,149
you and I think that's a really great

197
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,669
way to have a conversation just like to

198
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:18,439
talk about things so it feels like

199
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,909
something that someone that you like is

200
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,529
really interested in I think it's a

201
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,719
really cool thing to actually try to

202
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,759
like the interested in that too and not

203
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,039
just only five interest the things that

204
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,930
you're already interested in its all I

205
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,909
am saying like to like pretend to like

206
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,559
what that person is liking it might be a

207
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,240
thing in the world that you actually

208
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,099
didn't even know you were super

209
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,779
interested in yet and you don't gives

210
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,550
new things a chance then you'll never

211
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,229
know that I'm feeling it's cool to take

212
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,149
intro and things that other people are

213
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,499
also interested in and in that way you

214
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:47,509
guys can kind of find things that you're

215
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:49,189
both commonly interested in and then

216
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,709
it's a good way to like fall to people

217
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,719
and makes the relationship I really

218
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,339

220
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,999
thing to remember that even if you're

221
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,309

222
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,870
