1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
our lonely patch of the sky just got a

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,580
little less lonely with the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,770
identification of a rocky earth-sized

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,950
planet neighboring the star closest to

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,349
our own Sun on August twenty-fourth 2016

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,299
researchers announced the exciting news

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,060
that they had positively identified a

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,250
planet about 1.3 times the size of Earth

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:29,580
orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:31,230
Centauri 4.2 light-years away the

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,030
researchers made the discovery by

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,340
observing the star carefully over long

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,040
periods of time they found that once

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,440
every 11.2 days the light from the star

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,960
shifted ever so slightly a variation

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,820
called a Doppler shift during which the

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,379
star appeared to be moving toward Earth

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,690
slightly and then away from Earth

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,059
slightly that wobble indicated the

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,100
presence of a planet but it's closest to

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,500
us in distance and size isn't the only

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,360
thrilling thing about the discovery the

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,399
researchers also pointed out that the

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,100
planet orbits the star in an area that

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,870
might be considered habitable if Proxima

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,850
be has managed to hang on to an

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,220
atmosphere and liquid water it might be

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,530
hospitable to life there is no guarantee

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,530
that the planet has either an atmosphere

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,560
or water Proxima be orbits Proxima

31
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,310
Centauri every 11.2 days at a distance

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,780
of 7.5 million kilometers or about 5% of

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,689
the distance between the Earth and the

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,119
Sun for comparison mercury orbits the

35
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,880
Sun at an average of fifty seven point

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,890
nine million kilometers if Proxima

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,329
Centauri were like the Sun the short

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,090
distance between the two would be enough

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,130
to at least fry the planet's surface but

40
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,979
Proxima Centauri is a much dimmer

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,960
smaller star and at that distance of

42
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,759
less than eight million kilometers the

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,619
researchers estimate that the planet

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,840
would get about sixty-five percent of

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,850
the radiation that the earth proceeds

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,159
without an atmosphere the temperature

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,189
and Proxima B would be about negative 40

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,319
degrees Celsius that's really cold but

49
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,299
if earth didn't have an atmosphere our

50
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,819
planet would be a chill negative 20

51
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,459
degrees Celsius so we can't really talk

52
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,170
the distance is close enough that if the

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,149
planet managed to hang on to an

54
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,879
atmosphere it could potentially support

55
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,920
water in a liquid state that's if the

56
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,049
planet formed in such a way that water

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,019
in the protoplanet didn't just vaporize

58
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,760
in the early solar system or if it had

59
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,130
water delivered to it by comments later

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,319
in its life if you're noticing a lot of

61
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,450
ifs that's because a lot is still

62
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,250
unknown about our new neighbor while

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,200
computer models suggest that the planet

64
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,940
could hold water or an atmosphere or

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,530
even a magnetic field which would help

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,569
deflect deadly radiation from the

67
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,810
planet's surface there is no evidence

68
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,760
yet of any of those things unfortunately

69
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,220
heading out to Proxima Centauri for a

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,220
visit might take some time well it is

71
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,680
the closest star 4.24 layers is still a

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,599
very long way and getting there would

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,940
take thousands of years with our current

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,250
technology check out our episode on

75
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,959
light speed travel which details the

76
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,819
trip to Alpha Centauri and the

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,549
difficulty human space and getting there

78
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,260
until we can develop warp drive or some

79
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,389
other awesome tech that would allow us

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,790
to launch a robotic or manned mission to

81
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,349
Proxima be we will have to content

82
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,750
ourselves with telescope based

83
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,730
observations of the planet and rely on

84
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,440
those observations and models to tell us

85
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,349
more about what our closest neighbor

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,269
really looks like in the meantime our

87
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,980
generation will be defined by the

88
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,959
continued discoveries of other

89
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,849
potentially habitable worlds and our

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,370
continued quest to prove that there is

91
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,980
other life in our universe as Carl Sagan

92
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,430
once said somewhere something incredible

93
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:40,489
is waiting to be known
