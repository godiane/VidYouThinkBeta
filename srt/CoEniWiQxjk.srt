okay um I'm doing it as best I can do it

86
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:43,229
if you'll notice it's a lot than done I

87
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:46,919
when I started out there was no makeup

88
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:50,639
now I'm almost done completely the eyes

89
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:53,849
the makeup the hair and it will be a

90
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,709
beautiful result and you can see how

91
00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:03,479
easy it is when you see a person do and

92
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:10,289
that rather than not seeing it right now

93
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:16,259
and putting my makeup on and i'm putting

94
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:18,929
a little bit of Rouge in and then you

95
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,959
have to worry about the cheekbones they

96
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:25,949
have to get yours you have to make them

97
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,769
look just beautiful and then come when

98
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:32,459
that is done you go to the other side

99
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:36,899
the other cheek bone make them perfect

100
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:40,469
both to match and I see you're doing all

101
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:44,159
that and then as you were doing with the

102
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:49,289
bottom of the cheekbones it's just

103
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:54,360
coming out perfect but you have to do it

104
00:06:49,289 --> 00:07:00,899
step by step and you can hear is a step

105
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:03,749
and then now she's doing um to still in

106
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:06,629
