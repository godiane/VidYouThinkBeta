00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,388
Ah. Kill me.

4
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,733
I'm leaving.

HOMO FAG

6
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:12,753
Hey, did you hear?
Haruna and Shimizu are dating!

7
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,296
No way!

8
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,466
She went after a
boy from another school?

9
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,301
Who's Shimizu?

10
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,636
From cram school.

11
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,137
You should go, Tomo!

12
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,474
Nah, she's too poor!
And no father!

13
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,476
- Shut up!
- Go away, fattie!

14
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,104
- I'll eat you, pig!
- Gross!

15
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,147
Shut up, you dog!

16
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,317
You're gross and pathetic!

17
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,653
Whatever.

18
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,492
Where do they date?

19
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,162
At the park.
Sometimes at a theme park!

20
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,123
Just them?

21
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,834
No way! Isn't that weird?

22
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,296
I know. Crazy, right?

23
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,186
Wanna play my new game?

24
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:16,692
Kai, don't look at me at school.
Everyone will think I'm like you.

25
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,361
- I wasn't looking at you.
- Yes you were!

26
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,795
Thank you. Please come again.

27
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,297
Next in line?

28
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,306
Not again.

29
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,650
It's OK. I'll pay for them.

30
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,489
Damn her.

31
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,492
So irresponsible.

32
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,662
When do you finish?

33
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,664
At 5:00.

34
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,976
She quit her job.

35
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,691
Where'd she go this time?

36
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,985
I don't know.

37
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,196
Who with?

38
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,655
I don't know.

39
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,663
You poor thing,
to have a mother like that.

40
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,546
Tomo?

41
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,217
You've grown.

42
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,558
When was the last time?

43
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,228
Summer of third grade.

44
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,563
Oh.

45
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,400
She'll get dumped
and come back soon.

46
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,569
Whatever.

47
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,575
Hey, can I play Wii
when we get home?

48
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,743
Sure.

49
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,204
Did anyone beat
my high scores?

50
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,416
We'll have to see.

51
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,421
By the way...

52
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,759
I'm living with someone now.

53
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,100
Someone I really care about.

54
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,940
I told her about you.
She's happy to meet my niece.

55
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,568
But...

56
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,280
How should I say it...

57
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,407
She's unusual.

58
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,620
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

59
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,960
I thought I should tell you first.

60
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,283
We're home!

61
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,788
Hi.

62
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,634
Welcome, Tomo-chan.

63
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:39,848
I'm Rinko.

64
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,689
Come in.

65
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,494
Isn't my place better now?

66
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,539
More than just a TV and books.

67
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,678
Sorry to spring this on you, Rinko.
My sister's always been careless.

68
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,228
<i>HIGH SCORES</i>

69
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,691

71
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,747
I was so excited Tomo was coming,
I made lots of food.

72
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,043
Come on, let's eat!

73
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,045
Oh.

74
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,721
Tomo!

75
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,267
Thanks.

76
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,451
Bon appÃ©tit.

77
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,466
Eat all you like!

78
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,303
Thank you.

79
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,830
Good, isn't it?
Rinko's a great cook.

80
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,791
Oh, stop!

81
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,337
Anyone can cook.
You just follow the recipe.

82
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,344
Tomo-chan,
what foods do you like?

83
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,515
Oh, anything.
It's all delicious.

84
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,518
That's not an answer! Tell me.

85
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,687
Um...

86
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,359
Sliced dried radish and
clams in soy sauce.

87
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:41,029
Ha! Like some
old dude at a bar.

88
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,657
You'll be a drinker!

89
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,034
Why all the bar food?

90
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,705
I promise to make you some
while you're here.

91
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,175
Oh, now I want to eat clams
in soy sauce! Taiwanese style.

92
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,886
Maki-chan, another beer!

93
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,888
OK.

94
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:31,371
Get up from there, Maki-chan!

95
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,762
Maki-chan! Go take a bath!

96
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,109
Isn't he so tacky?

97
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,113
Where does he find
that ugly underwear?

98
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,631
Tomo-chan, help.

99
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,305
This OK?

100
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:31,806
Sure.

101
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,309
Sorry it's so tight.

102
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:35,977
It's OK.

103
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,316
How will you get to school?

104
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,318
By train?

105
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,490
No. It's a little far,
but I can walk it.

106
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:49,991
OK.

107
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:55,121
But I'll take tomorrow off and
get stuff from my house.

108
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,668
Alright, I'll make you a <i>bento.</i>

109
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:04,005
Don't worry about it.
I'll just buy lunch somewhere.

110
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,371
Did Makio tell you?

111
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,874
About me.

112
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,876
What?

113
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,878
You see...

114
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,216
I was born a boy.

115
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,386
Oh, yeah.

116
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,389
The work on my body's done,

117
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,058
but I'm still a man on paper.

118
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,352
Oh.

119
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,691
You know there are
people like me, right?

120
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,414
200 cc each.

121
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,917
E cup.

122
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,755
Wanna feel them?

123
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,089
Huh?

124
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,924
Go ahead.

125
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,096
No thanks.

126
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:46,274
That was fast, Makio!
Did you wash yourself?

127
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,776
I did.

128
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,277
Your pee-pee too?

129
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,280
Scrubbed the top and bottom.

130
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,782
Are you sure?

131
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,952
Good night.

132
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,627
Hey, you'll catch cold!

133
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,641
Here you are.

134
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,317
Good morning.

135
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,659
Hello!

136
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:44,332
I'm Saito of
Samejima Pharmaceuticals.

137
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:49,003
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

138
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,840
Mr. Saito! Your meal's over there.

139
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,349
This hand...

140
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,020
belongs to an honest
but stubborn person.

141
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,023
OK.

142
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,204
"LUNCH FOR YOU, TOMO-CHAN."

143
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,250
Tomo, you OK?

144
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,254
You weren't at school. You sick?

145
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,591
Wanna play?

146
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,594
Don't you have cram school?

147
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,597
No. I'm focusing on music lessons.

148
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,765
Oh.

149
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,266
Wanna play?

150
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,894
Can't today.

151
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,270
Tomorrow?

152
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,440
Can't tomorrow.
Or the next day. Or ever.

153
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,445
I won't be back here for a while.
Don't wait for me.

154
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,780
Why?

155
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,616
Wait, why?

156
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,951
It's nothing.

157
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,287
Did your mom leave?

158
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,797
I'm home.

159
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,769
Tomo-chan?

160
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:05,987
Are you OK?

161
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,448
What's wrong?

162
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,843
Oh no!

163
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,361
Take this.

164
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,052
You didn't have to eat it.

165
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:16,724
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have pushed you.

166
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,852
You said you
didn't need lunch.

167
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,901
That's not it.

168
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,572
You put eyes
on the sausages.

169
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:35,535
I'd never seen
such a cute <i>bento.</i>

170
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,913
I wanted to save it.

171
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,917
To take my time
and enjoy it later.

172
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,253
Then it spoiled.

173
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,090
But I still wanted to eat it.

174
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,095
Oh Tomo...

175
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,599
You're so precious
I can't stand it!

176
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,953
SEX AND YOUR BODY

177
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,455
What're you reading?

178
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,585
Don't talk to me at school.

179
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,130
Why not?
No one can see us.

180
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:15,009
See the guy in the
red shirt playing soccer?

181
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,348
That's Ono-kun. 6th grade.

182
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,351
When I think of him...

183
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,854
I feel all tingly here.

184
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,858
Gross.

185
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,865
What'll happen to me?

186
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,064
You didn't lock the door!
What if someone came in?

187
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,735
You're Tomo-chan?

188
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,241
Keep the door locked
when you're home alone.

189
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,246
Oops!

190
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,748
You're dead!

191
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,547
I'm Rinko's mother.

192
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,093
This is my husband,
Yoshio-kun.

193
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:40,761
Hi.

194
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,725
Rinko's coworker is sick so
she's filling in for her tonight.

195
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:49,603
Makio's working late too,
so they asked me to come.

196
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,273
Where shall we eat?

197
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,122
How old are you?

198
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,957
11.

199
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,299
Are your boobs growing?

200
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,262
Not yet?

201
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,143
I'll bet your nipples are sore.

202
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,611
I made Rinko's first breasts
when she was in 8th grade.

203
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,823
Just imagine.

204
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,327
How sad it would be

205
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:50,998
to be a girl inside
but to just stay flat there.

206
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,259
Hey, Tomo-chan?

207
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,180
One thing.

208
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:11,185
I won't let you hurt Rinko.

209
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,815
I don't care if you're a child.
I'll never forgive you.

210
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,531
Fumiko!

211
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,034
You're like a <i>yakuza</i>!

212
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,704
Am I?

213
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,879
Outer sweep. 1.

214
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:44,885
2.

215
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,181
Shoulder throw.

216
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,559
1.

217
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,957
Did you know, ma'am?

218
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,627
This whole year.

219
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,797
He lost his judo uniform.
And his swimsuit.

220
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,925
And he's skipping class.

221
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,135
What?

222
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,597
Well, he's skipping PE.

223
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,642
He's going to his other classes.

224
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,937
Of course, you couldn't tell
looking at his grades...

225
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:23,943
Is he blowing us off?
Like PE's not important to him?

226
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,656
I don't think that's it...

227
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,495
We're at a loss over here.

228
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,165
Maybe...

229
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,835
he has his own reason.

230
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,965
It doesn't matter!
PE is mandatory!

231
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,805
Rin-chan?

232
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,700
I talked with the PE coach
in that ugly track suit.

233
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,000
What's wrong?

234
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,550
Mom...

235
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,055
I wish...

236
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,520
I had boobs.

237
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,550
Of course.

238
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,262
After all...

239
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,057
you're a girl.

240
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,735
Don't cry.

241
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,614
There's nothing wrong with you.

242
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,296
- I'm home.
- Rin-chan?

243
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,964
Here.

244
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,149
Try it on.

245
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,685
Put these in.

246
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,360
They need more cotton.

247
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,366
I can't give you real ones.

248
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,996
But for now,
here are your fake boobs.

249
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,047
Here.

250
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,747
Hello.

251
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,957
Hello.

252
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,792
How do you do?

253
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:36,296
I'm Saito of
Samejima Pharmaceuticals.

254
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,132
It's nice to meet you.

255
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,468
Hello, I'm Ogawa.

256
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,928
Mr. Saito!

257
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,264
The restroom's there.

258
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,824
Come in.

259
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,161
Ms. Ogawa? Makio's here.

260
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,667
She's doing great today.

261
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,670
She had a big breakfast.

262
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,048
Good. I really appreciate it.

263
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,174
Sure.

264
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,343
Take your time.

265
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,356
Mom, I brought Tomo.

266
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,276
Your granddaughter.
Remember?

267
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,657
Hello Grandma.

268
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,205
How sloppy, Hiromi!

269
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,709
A woman should dress properly!

270
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,544
This isn't Hiromi.

271
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,838
It's Hiromi's daughter, Tomo.

272
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,219
I brought you some
sweet potato cake.

273
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,015
Cake?

274
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,904
Did Grandma hate my mom?

275
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,746
Hate's too strong a word.

276
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:34,748
But...

277
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:39,419
Mom was always
really hard on her.

278
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,589
It got worse after Dad died.

279
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,718
Parents and children

280
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,054
are still people.

281
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,058
Sometimes they don't get along.

282
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:59,773
But I don't think it means
they "hate" each other.

283
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,945
In fact, maybe they
love each other so much

284
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,115
that it all backfires.

285
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,914
Mom said
she abandoned Grandma.

286
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,087
Kind of.

287
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,634
But if she hadn't,
you wouldn't have been born.

288
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,810
Even I'm glad I could
put her in this home.

289
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,107
After your mom left home,

290
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,987
Grandma made me a <i>bento</i>
every single day,

291
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,783
and waited up for me
no matter how late.

292
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,163
Honestly, it made me depressed.

293
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,001
I shouldn't say this.

294
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,672
But when I lived with her,

295
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:10,510
I constantly thought about
how I could escape.

296
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,366
I wonder if Mom will
abandon me too.

297
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,877
Your mom...

298
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:50,675
is someone who can't
get her priorities straight.

299
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,054
Some people are like that.

300
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,848
It's a shame.

301
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:02,562
What's your first priority, Makio?

302
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:09,236
Rinko, of course!
Isn't it obvious?

303
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:14,908
So how did you and
Rinko start dating?

304
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:22,582
Well, it was...

305
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,252
love at first sight.

306
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,753
Really?

307
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,255
Yeah.

308
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,926
When I saw how gently

309
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:38,431
she washes Mom's body...

310
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,104
What can I say...

311
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,774
Her beauty

312
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,110
made me cry.

313
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,950
Of course, when I learned
she used to be a man

314
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,119
I got really confused.

315
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,623
But I'd fallen in love,
and that was that.

316
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:09,129
When you fall for
someone like Rinko,

317
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:14,301
nothing else matters.

318
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,638
Man, woman...

319
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:23,310
None of that
makes any difference.

320
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,314
I'm here!

321
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,482
Sorry I'm late.

322
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,818
You must be starving!

323
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,486
Thanks!

324
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,489
This is great!

325
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,163
Bon appÃ©tit.

326
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,175
Clean-up took forever.

327
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,509
Good job.

328
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,041
Tomo? What's wrong?

329
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,043
Tomo?

330
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:37,050
<i>Just give her a rice ball</i>
<i>and she'll be fine!</i>

331
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:39,511
<i>You love them,</i>
<i>don't you, Tomo?</i>

332
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,889
<i>Come on, eat up!</i>

333
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,683
<i>Here.</i>

334
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,657
Tomo-chan?

335
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,923
What's wrong?

336
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,098
It's OK.

337
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,102
It's alright.

338
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,624
This towel's a mess.

339
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,424
I don't care.

340
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,636
You're still a baby!

341
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:08,141
Here, baby!

342
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:12,228
Such a good little baby.

343
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,814
Let me hold you.

344
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,161
Hey...

345
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:31,748
Your boobs.

346
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,667
I wanna feel them.

347
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,798
Go ahead.

348
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,852
Compared to real ones,

349
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,314
they're a little firm.

350
00:46:58,817 --> 00:46:59,818
Are they?

351
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,322
Yeah.

352
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:07,158
Maybe a little firm.

353
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,871
But they feel nice.

354
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,391
C'mon, Makio! Pass her!

355
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,240
C'mon, Makio!

356
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,576
You can pass her!

357
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,752
This is great!

358
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,355
Clams in soy sauce

359
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,274
and sliced dried radish.

360
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,776
Dig in.

361
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:24,903
- OK.
- Thanks.

362
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,447
Bon appÃ©tit.

363
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:47,133
Good?

364
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,302
- Really good!
- I'm glad.

365
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:26,172
Tomo, you didn't
put away the Wii.

366
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:32,762
Come on. You know
you're supposed to put it away.

367
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,180
OK, fine.

368
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,849
No "OK, fine"!

369
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,351
Shut up.

370
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:41,646
Ouch! That's abuse!

371
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,273
See you later.

372
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:46,025
Later.

373
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:51,322
- Does the next one go under?
- No, it goes over.

374
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,366
Oh, thank you.

375
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,543
What?

376
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,879
You're looking gorgeous, Yuka.

377
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,383
No! Really?!

378
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,387
Your beauty is
gushing out from within.

379
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,724
Like you can't contain it.

380
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:26,566
But my fiancÃ© and I
are so poor, it sucks!

381
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:32,238
We're trying to keep it simple
but everything costs so much.

382
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:37,243
He said I should
bake our wedding cake!

383
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,580
To save money!
Can you believe that jerk?

384
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,084
I doubt we'll even
make it to the big day.

385
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,254
You'll be fine!

386
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:54,761
I don't know.
He's such a bonehead.

387
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:05,938
Tomo, anything you want
to eat today?

388
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:08,941
Salted squid.

389
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,111
You really are an old dude!

390
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,284
Salted squid...

391
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,813
There's that girl!

392
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:48,815
Tomo?

393
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:50,775
Tomo.

394
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,320
Let's go.

395
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:09,168
Oh, go get me some
dishwashing soap.

396
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,628
OK.

397
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,345
Tomo-chan?

398
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,351
Hello.

399
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,354
I heard your mom left.

400
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,860
Are you eating well?

401
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,364
You sure you're OK?

402
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,701
Who's that weirdo you're with?

403
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:48,374
Listen. If you need help,
come over anytime.

404
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,836
Kai and I are on your side.

405
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,714
You're not alone.

406
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,009
Maybe it's not my business,

407
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:02,054
but you should stay away
from people like that.

408
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,187
Stop!

409
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:20,198
<i>One, a chick</i>

410
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:25,661
<i>In a basket</i>
<i>"Dairoku-nenne"</i>

411
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:32,210
<i>Two, a boat</i>

412
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:37,924
<i>The boatman</i>
<i>"Dairoku-nenne"</i>

413
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:43,930
<i>Three, Miyo-chan</i>

414
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:49,435
<i>Holding a toy</i>
<i>"Dairoku-nenne"</i>

415
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:01,739
The victim doesn't want
to report it, either.

416
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:06,452
So just pay her
cleaning bills, OK?

417
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:11,123
I am truly sorry.

418
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,461
You too, Tomo!

419
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,967
I apologize.

420
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,671
Let's go home.

421
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,676
I'm sorry.

422
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,562
Why didn't you

423
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,899
apologize to that lady?

424
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:09,408
Did she say
something to you?

425
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,664
About me?

426
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,256
Hey, Tomo.

427
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:28,219
Whatever happens,

428
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,596
whatever people say,

429
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,099
you mustn't do that.

430
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,435
Just swallow it,

431
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,105
hold it in,

432
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,775
and wait for your
anger to pass.

433
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:46,904
What if it doesn't pass?

434
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:11,637
I do this

435
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,100
when I'm really
pissed off

436
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,478
or so depressed
I want to die.

437
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,106
I just knit.

438
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,109
Instead of spraying
people with soap.

439
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,113
"Stupid jerk!"

440
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,867
"Dammit! Dammit!"

441
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,119
With each stitch.

442
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,956
I do this,

443
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:44,962
and after a while
my feelings are smoothed out.

444
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,511
Did you make
Makio's belly-warmer?

445
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,138
I did.

446
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,348
I can make you something.

447
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:59,852
A scarf, a sweater, gloves.

448
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:01,353
What'll it be?

449
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,191
It's too warm
to think about it.

450
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:07,359
Of course.

451
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:16,827
But you know,
my mother

452
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,872
never bought me
anything woolen.

453
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,707
Why?

454
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,542
I dunno.

455
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,387
What's this?
You have so many.

456
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:39,892
Those are my...

457
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,853
worldly desires.

458
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,897
What?

459
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,735
When I had my surgery,

460
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,905
I felt really terrible.

461
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,575
It was so
painful and itchy.

462
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,540
I wondered why I had
to suffer so much.

463
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,377
Did I do something wrong?

464
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:13,050
But it wasn't my mistake.
God messed up when He formed me.

465
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:16,929
This is for

466
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,267
my "manhood memorial service".

467
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,436
Manhood?

468
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,439
So...

469
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,109
this is your...

470
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:32,903
My pee-pee.

471
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,781
You freak!

472
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:37,950
How rude!

473
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,955
Once I've made 108
of these, I'll burn them.

474
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,457
Why 108?

475
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,962
With sales tax?

476
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,297
Silly!

477
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:56,302
Buddhist teachings say
we have 108 desires.

478
00:59:57,386 --> 01:00:00,764
The temple bells ring
108 times on New Year's Eve.

479
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:04,476
And a chanting rosary
has 108 beads.

480
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:09,940
After my "service,"

481
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,652
I'll change my
family registry to female.

482
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:24,830
I wanna make
one of those too.

483
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:32,671
OK, look here.

484
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,176
Take your index
and middle fingers

485
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:41,847
and hold this
thread like this.

486
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:43,682
OK?

487
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,187
Like this?

488
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:51,023
Your index finger, yeah.

489
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,692
Just like that.

490
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,196
Then this needle

491
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,657
goes up here

492
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:03,702
and then you
put it through there.

493
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,663
That's it!

494
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,265
Hey, Makio?

495
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,768
To me...

496
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:13,105
Tomo-chan...

497
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,735
is just so precious
I can't stand it.

498
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,075
So...

499
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,287
maybe...

500
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:34,460
if her mom
doesn't come back...

501
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:40,799
do you think
we could adopt her?

502
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:49,141
If I change my registry to female,
and you and I get married...

503
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,980
could I be her mom?

504
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:05,991
I'm sorry.

505
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,828
You're not thinking of marriage.

506
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:12,331
I went overboard.

507
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,341
That's not true.

508
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:29,515
I'm not just
playing around with you.

509
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,813
I accept your feelings.
All of them.

510
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,821
Let's think what's
best for Tomo.

511
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,864
Together.

512
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,519
She's here!

513
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,193
TOMO OGAWA
FREAK FAMILY

514
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,035
You.

515
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,146
Mom?

516
01:05:58,997 --> 01:05:59,998
Mom?

517
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:08,191
Tomo, where have you been?

518
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,241
School said you
weren't there today.

519
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:18,243
What were you doing?

520
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,413
We were worried.

521
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,251
Answer us!

522
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:31,923
You're not even my mother.

523
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,383
Tomo!

524
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,152
DO NOT FEED THE FISH

525
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:54,696
DO NOT FEED THE FISH
<i>One, a chick</i>

526
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,740
<i>One, a chick</i>

527
01:07:56,948 --> 01:08:01,953
<i>In a basket</i>
<i>"Dairoku-nenne"</i>

528
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:07,292
<i>Two, a boat</i>

529
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:12,964
<i>The boatman</i>
<i>"Dairoku-nenne"</i>

530
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:16,301
<i>Three...</i>

531
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:26,603
Your hands!
They're huge!

532
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,319
Let me see.

533
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:56,091
Wow, you're good!

534
01:08:57,926 --> 01:08:59,678
I did this a lot.

535
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:05,016
My husband was
never faithful.

536
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,854
He left to live
with some woman

537
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,523
and never came home.

538
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:15,652
I was so distraught...

539
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:20,031
I had to keep myself occupied.

540
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,994
My kids' sweaters
and scarves...

541
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,038
I knitted them all.

542
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,212
But...

543
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:40,051
Hiromi didn't wear a
single one of them.

544
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,554
She hated them.

545
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,225
But she was a sensitive girl.

546
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:52,731
She must have picked up
on my feelings.

547
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,903
But regardless...

548
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:01,531
you do so much for them,

549
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,242
and then they
go off somewhere.

550
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,080
Children are so ungrateful.

551
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,917
Don't you think?

552
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,883
I couldn't throw them away,
so I kept everything I knit.

553
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:24,095
I filled up five huge boxes
in three years.

554
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,768
When my husband finally
came back, he was dead.

555
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:35,440
We hadn't divorced,
so they brought me his corpse.

556
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:40,278
In his coffin,

557
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:45,951
I stuffed everything I'd knitted.

558
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:53,458
Rest eternally
with my fury. Ha ha!

559
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,422
Keep this all a secret.

560
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,155
Stay away from Tomo-chan.

561
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,491
Even at school.

562
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,494
Why?

563
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,331
You saw who she was with.
That's not normal.

564
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,962
What is "normal"?

565
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:43,174
Normal is normal.
Not strange.

566
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,890
I'm home.

567
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:03,421
Ah, I'm exhausted.

568
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:19,938
Whoever invented beer
deserves a Nobel Prize.

569
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,740
Aren't you hot in there?

570
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,624
Here.

571
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:41,960
This is for you.

572
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,309
Tomo?

573
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,440
Let's share...

574
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:05,984
secrets.

575
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:18,955
Um...

576
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,166
First...

577
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:26,171
My special secret.

578
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,010
My name used to be...

579
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,056
Rintaro.

580
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,186
Oh gosh!

581
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,863
I changed my name
and my body,

582
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,993
but I can't make
these hands smaller.

583
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,541
Just like these hands,

584
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,169
there's something

585
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:09,047
I cannot do

586
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:13,551
no matter how hard I try.

587
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,559
I can't have Makio's baby.

588
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,363
Your turn.

589
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:48,419
Yesterday...

590
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,549
I saw my mom.

591
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:19,784
I'm going to go
buy some yarn.

592
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,749
Put away the Wii, OK?

593
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,181
Can't she go home?

594
01:17:23,348 --> 01:17:26,351
She hit her head.
We need to do tests.

595
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:28,519
Can't you do something?

596
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,146
I'm afraid...

597
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,689
Please.

598
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:37,153
She just needs tests.
Can't you manage for one night?

599
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:41,699
No, we can't. She's a woman.
Isn't it obvious?

600
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:46,037
The insurance card says "male."

601
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,836
I can't accept this.
Put her in the women's ward.

602
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:56,547
We have no beds.

603
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,508
So what?

604
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:03,221
There's a private room that costs
$4,000 a night. Should I transfer?

605
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:09,894
This is a violation of her human rights.
This is discrimination!

606
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:13,231
Please keep your voice down.

607
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,093
I'm sorry.

608
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,479
Don't cry.

609
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,817
I'm so mad!

610
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,662
You did good.

611
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,333
You held it in.

612
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:01,399
Whoever invented beer
deserves a Nobel Prize.

613
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:14,912
You're fast!

614
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:20,418
I've decided to go through with
my "memorial service"

615
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:22,920
and become a woman.

616
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,391
Let me try.

617
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,102
OK.

618
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:40,730
Take this...

619
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:48,946
Then...

620
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:53,284
Put this in between here.

621
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,244
Like this.

622
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:59,123
Here it comes!

623
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,924
Another hot pot?

624
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,469
Of course!
Today calls for it.

625
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,264
So everyone can share.

626
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,474
I agree.

627
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:21,646
Eat up!

628
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:26,984
Let's toast.

629
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:29,987
Cheers!

630
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,495
Your plate.

631
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,331
Bon appÃ©tit.

632
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,833
Looks delicious!

633
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:46,671
This isn't just
the usual chicken.

634
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:50,299
It's a special breed
called Shamrock.

635
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:52,843
Shamrock.

636
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,512
Shamrock.

637
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,516
Shamrock.

638
01:22:58,808 --> 01:22:59,892
Looks delicious!

639
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,686
Thanks.

640
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,691
Let me try!

641
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,359
This looks good!

642
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:17,368
Makio-kun?

643
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,204
How's your mother?

644
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:24,875
She's hanging in there.
Rinko's taking good care of her.

645
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:27,545
Good.

646
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:33,676
I say, you are quite
the lucky woman!

647
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:34,885
Why?

648
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,846
Just look!

649
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:40,558
I thought you'd never
find a husband,

650
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:43,728
but Makio's so understanding.

651
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,397
That alone is amazing.

652
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:50,067
But his father's already dead!
And his mother...

653
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,238
How should I say it?

654
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:00,202
Mother!

655
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:02,747
But it's all true!

656
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,334
If Makio's parents were healthy,

657
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,881
we'd have a hard time
getting them to accept you.

658
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,763
I know it's terribly
rude of me...

659
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,724
But aren't we lucky!

660
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,768
Cut it out, Mom!

661
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:28,105
Because nothing's more important
to me than my daughter!

662
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:37,239
Thanks.

663
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,616
This is good.

664
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:42,953
So, Tomo-chan?
Are your boobs bigger?

665
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:44,955
Mother!

666
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:05,309
Wanna play Wii?

667
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,829
Game over.

668
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:32,962
Let's do it again!

669
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:37,842
No! All this playing
has made me hungry.

670
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,010
Let's get cake! You too, Kai!

671
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,178
Yay!

672
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,032
What year were you born?

673
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:03,534
2004.

674
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:06,203
That would be Heisei...

675
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:07,371
Year 16.

676
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:09,373
- You too, Kai?
- Yeah.

677
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:15,546
Carrying a coin from your
birth year brings good luck.

678
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:16,714
Really?

679
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:21,010
If that really brought luck, then
the whole world would be happy.

680
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:24,221
Whether or not to believe it
is up to you.

681
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:29,727
Oh, there's only one 2004!

682
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:35,566
No fair!
You don't even believe it.

683
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:38,402
I don't. But I'll take it anyway.

684
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,095
Go to bed.

685
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,773
83.

686
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,775
84.

687
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:19,777
85.

688
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,446
86!

689
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,407
We need 22 more.

690
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:31,413
Did you knit this one, Makio?
It's leaning to the left!

691
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,749
It was probably me.

692
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,752
It turned out like mine.

693
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:39,463
Shut up. Yours isn't this big!

694
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,299
Like this?

695
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,677
Mine isn't that small!

696
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,972
Don't make a mess!

697
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:50,641
- How about this?
- That's huge!

698
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:53,978
Cut it out!

699
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:55,813
What a mess!

700
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:10,869
Ow!

701
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:30,180
Tomo.

702
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:34,310
Do you want to
stay with us?

703
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,023
We'll move somewhere bigger.

704
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,859
Give you a room.

705
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:09,053
"PLEASE" DO NOT FEED THE FISH

706
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:22,733
Mr. Saito, there you are!

707
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:25,235
Time for your bath.

708
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,248
This hand...

709
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:43,087
belongs to a
pure-hearted person.

710
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:27,131
"Dear Ono-kun
I like you..."

711
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:48,819
I'll do the towels.

712
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,656
Then I'll fold your
ugly underwear.

713
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,158
They're not ugly.

714
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:55,325
Yes they are.

715
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:56,994
No they aren't!

716
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,495
Yes they are!

717
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,666
Is that Rinko?

718
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:11,633
Good evening.

719
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:15,012
We're from
Child Protective Services.

720
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:17,848
Yes?

721
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,534
How long has Tomo
been living here?

722
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:41,705
About a month.

723
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,666
Her mother hasn't come home?

724
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:51,548
That's right. I'm her uncle
and I'm taking care of her.

725
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:03,060
Good evening.

726
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,396
Good evening.

727
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:16,240
We were notified that this
is not a good environment for her.

728
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,409
But...

729
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:23,247
May I talk with Tomo
one-on-one?

730
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:15,257
Is anything bothering you?

731
01:33:16,592 --> 01:33:18,969
Can I see your arm?

732
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,474
OK, now the other one.

733
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:35,819
Does anywhere hurt?
Have you been injured?

734
01:33:37,321 --> 01:33:38,488
You're OK?

735
01:37:33,223 --> 01:37:36,393
That was close!
Your mom almost saw me.

736
01:37:38,562 --> 01:37:43,525
Must be nice to be rich!
Is this room $4,000 a night?

737
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,069
It's not that much.

738
01:37:47,487 --> 01:37:50,240
Hey, what's it like
before you die?

739
01:37:50,407 --> 01:37:55,245
They say a bright light pulls you.
Did you see your dead grandpa?

740
01:37:57,831 --> 01:38:01,418
I don't remember.
And my grandpa's still alive!

741
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,379
You should remember!
Bonehead.

742
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:16,725
I wrote Ono-kun a letter.

743
01:38:18,602 --> 01:38:19,769
A love letter?

744
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:22,439
Yeah.

745
01:38:25,901 --> 01:38:27,110
Did you give it?

746
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:33,783
Mom saw it first
and ripped it up.

747
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:38,288
Crap. I'd want to die too.

748
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:44,294
I know. Why am I still alive?

749
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:52,636
Mom told me

750
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:56,306
I'm a very sinful boy.

751
01:39:06,483 --> 01:39:09,819
Your mom is wrong sometimes.

752
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:16,493
Because that is totally not true.

753
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:18,495
Totally not true!

754
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:20,830
Toooooo...

755
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,333
tally!

756
01:41:16,613 --> 01:41:17,781
So, Rinko?

757
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:22,786
What will happen to the
pee-pee you cut off?

758
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,247
That's a bold question, Tomo.

759
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:31,628
We're knitting all these pee-pees,
so I think it's OK to ask.

760
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,255
You don't have to answer, Rinko.

761
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:42,555
They didn't completely cut it off.
They recycled it.

762
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:44,641
Recycled it?

763
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:49,145
They took out the insides...

764
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:53,817
turned the skin inside-out...

765
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,278
and stuck it inside the opening.

766
01:42:04,536 --> 01:42:06,329
Awesome.

767
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:10,125
Awesome.

768
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:19,843
Tomo, get a big one.

769
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:25,014
- Here.
- Thanks.

770
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,684
Ah, some went over there!

771
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,479
Thanks.

772
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,198
102.

773
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:45,535
103.

774
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:48,204
104.

775
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:50,039
105.

776
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:53,710
106.

777
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:57,338
107...

778
01:43:04,053 --> 01:43:05,680
108.

779
01:44:59,252 --> 01:45:02,005
Thank you. Please come again.

780
01:45:02,338 --> 01:45:04,007
Next in line?

781
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:24,027
I'm home.

782
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,487
Hey. Been a while.

783
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:29,490
How've you been?

784
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,539
Why are you so quiet?

785
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:40,209
Where have you been?

786
01:45:40,877 --> 01:45:43,046
Oh, here and there.

787
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:46,215
And now I'm flat broke!

788
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:49,218
I'd better start working again.

789
01:45:51,888 --> 01:45:53,056
Let's go home.

790
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,062
Thanks for helping out.

791
01:46:06,903 --> 01:46:08,029
We're going.

792
01:46:08,488 --> 01:46:09,572
Hiromi...

793
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:13,409
Actually...

794
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:17,914
About Tomo...

795
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:24,754
We want to take her in.

796
01:46:26,798 --> 01:46:28,383
Rinko and I

797
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:32,261
want to give her
a good home.

798
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:36,265
What?

799
01:46:36,474 --> 01:46:37,767
I'm serious.

800
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:40,603
So is Rinko.

801
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:45,274
Rinko really cares about Tomo.

802
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:47,944
She loves her.

803
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,455
You're joking.

804
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:03,793
Rinko wants to be her mother.

805
01:47:06,254 --> 01:47:09,799
But that's impossible!
I mean, that person...

806
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:20,601
Makio.

807
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:25,314
I won't say anything about
your sexual orientation.

808
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:26,816
I mean...

809
01:47:27,567 --> 01:47:29,318
It was a shock,

810
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:33,281
but I respect that.
However...

811
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:34,782
Please.

812
01:47:37,326 --> 01:47:40,997
We'll take good care of Tomo.

813
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:43,166
Please.

814
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:55,511
What are you talking about?!
This is ridiculous!

815
01:47:56,179 --> 01:47:57,680
She's my girl.

816
01:48:00,016 --> 01:48:02,852
But this isn't the first time.

817
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,355
You abandon Tomo,

818
01:48:07,315 --> 01:48:10,026
quit work and go off
with some guy.

819
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:12,653
You're too irresponsible!

820
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:19,368
I just left her with you
for a while.

821
01:48:22,538 --> 01:48:23,706
I mean...

822
01:48:24,874 --> 01:48:26,209
I'm a woman.

823
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:28,711
That comes before
being a mother.

824
01:48:29,378 --> 01:48:30,379
Come on!

825
01:48:31,589 --> 01:48:36,052
I'm raising her all alone.
I need a break sometimes!

826
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:38,971
Can't you accept that?

827
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:40,389
We can't.

828
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:45,061
Before you're a woman,
a mother

829
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:49,190
must protect her child.
As a human, as an adult.

830
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:00,076
What do you know?!

831
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:02,745
You're not a mother.
Or even a woman.

832
01:49:04,914 --> 01:49:06,707
Rinko is a woman.

833
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:12,255
Then tell me.

834
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:16,592
When Tomo has her period,
can you help her?

835
01:49:18,678 --> 01:49:24,433
Do you know what kind of bra
she'll need first? No, you don't!

836
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:30,606
You can't be a mother.

837
01:49:33,025 --> 01:49:34,443
Think about it.

838
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:39,448
You will never,
ever be a mother!

839
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:47,623
Hey! Stop it!

840
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:54,797
Rinko made me meals.
She made me a cute <i>bento.</i>

841
01:49:54,964 --> 01:49:57,091
She did my hair for me.

842
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:59,802
She taught me to knit.
She slept with me.

843
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:02,805
Stop it!

844
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:04,307
So what?!

845
01:50:04,974 --> 01:50:07,310
Why won't you do that?

846
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:12,148
Why didn't you
come to get me sooner?

847
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:28,664
Because I don't know how.

848
01:50:32,335 --> 01:50:34,003
I wish I did...

849
01:50:35,838 --> 01:50:37,173
But I don't.

850
01:50:40,051 --> 01:50:42,178
And sometimes it kills me.

851
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,205
Mom!

852
01:51:09,789 --> 01:51:12,375
Mom! Mom!

853
01:51:14,877 --> 01:51:17,380
I'm going with you, Mom!

854
01:51:50,996 --> 01:51:54,750
But you go ahead today.

855
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,275
Hiromi?

856
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:25,239
Tomo...

857
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,618
really hates...

858
01:52:31,746 --> 01:52:33,122
convenience store rice balls.

859
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:18,793
Oh, thank goodness.

860
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,003
Huh?

861
01:53:23,214 --> 01:53:25,174
The Wii...

862
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:28,135
clothes on the floor...

863
01:53:29,595 --> 01:53:33,015
I'm so glad I don't have
to put those away anymore.

864
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:38,354
Me too.

865
01:53:38,813 --> 01:53:42,691
I'm glad you won't be
pulling my hair anymore.

866
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:04,046
I'm sorry.

867
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:12,179
Don't apologize.

868
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:16,892
I'll be sad.

869
01:55:46,315 --> 01:55:53,322

874

Yeah, I'm fine.

875
01:59:57,566 --> 02:00:02,529
Tomo, take good care
of your mom.

876
02:00:08,368 --> 02:00:09,536
I will.

877
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:08,971
