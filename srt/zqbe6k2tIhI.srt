00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
(Arabic) As salaamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuhu
( Eng: Peace be unto you)

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:19,180
…..I am blessed with the opportunity to speak with my respected brothers and sisters and the entire ummat.

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,760
Concerning the calamity that took place in New Zealand a few days ago,

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,860
in which a savage and insane man massacred 50 muslims in two mosques.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,820
I would like to say a few words.

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,780
Allah has given us the true and correct way of life,

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,340
Arabic : SubhanAllah - Eng: God is perfect

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,800
in which there is absolutely no scope for rewarding oppression with oppression

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:12,720
You would be surprised to know that in the annals of history, , since the dawn of conflict, our beloved Nabi is the first person to formulate regulations for war.

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,960
“Look, you are going to battle, but you are not to kill the elderly,women,priests,children,

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,200
and those who are the pops of Christ's and children.

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,640
You are not allowed to destroy trees or burn crops, nor are you allowed to take up arms against those who have laid down theirs.

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,280
You should immediately accept those who surrender or offer treaties of peace.”

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,920
If he taught us such beautiful principles for war, then what beautiful principles for the rest of life must he have shown us?

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,880
The ummat has responded to this heinous act.

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:09,040
Firstly, we do not reward oppression with oppression,nor do we have permission from Allah or his Rasool to do so.

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:21,160
Those who have been martyred,

18
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,120
they have now gone to paradise by the will of Allah,and will enjoy its eternal success and have been blessed to be the recipients of Allah’s pleasure.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:35,240
. To be martyred in namaaz(salaah),in the masjid,on Jumuah(Friday), how many virtues and accolades have been afforded to them. Also they were murdered in a horrible way.

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:45,320
Considering all of these things, I have hope in the mercy of Allah hat he will admit them to the highest stages of Paradise.

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,240
Along with this, we also have to ask Allah to guide the man who committed these horrendous acts,

22
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:13,160
as well as all the people of the world who do not know about Islam. We have to make dua for them that Allah gives them the guidance to follow the correct and true faith.

23
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,040
Our prophet Muhammad S.A.W conquered Makkah.

24
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,800
For 21 years, the people of Makkah had exhausted all their strength in trying to kill him.

25
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,040
How many difficulties did he have to bear from them?

26
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:39,480
When he conquered Makkah, everyone thought that he will execute us, we will be beheaded, and we will be crucified.

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:50,560
May I be sacrificed for his beautiful character 
(How beautiful was his character). 
He said “How should I treat you all?”

28
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
They were all gathered in the Haram.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Suhail bin Amr (RA), who had not till then accepted Islam replied

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:14,560
Suhail bin Amr (RA) said “You are a person of lofty, noble character and you are the son of those who possessed lofty and noble character. We hope that you will forgive us.”

31
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,080
The Prophet of Allah replied

32
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:28,800
Arabic

33
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,880
SubhanAllah  (Allah is perfact)

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:44,400
The Prophet of Allah replied 
“Today I will say to you just as my brother Yusuf had said to his brothers after undergoing hardship for 40 years.

35
00:04:44,760 --> 00:05:02,920
Go, you are forgiven, you are guilty of nothing. You are all free, I have forgiven you all.”

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:13,680
The Arabic word “Laa Tathreeb” means that you are not guilty of anything. “Go on, live freely.”

37
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,200
In 21 years, how many miracles would they have seen?

38
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,600
They saw the moon split in two pieces, water gushing from the his blessed fingers

39
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,680
his spitting in a well which resulted in its water rising,

40
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,680
small pebbles reciting the praise of Allah in his hands.

41
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,840
He cooked the leg of a sheep which fed 40 men.

42
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,680
Miracles after miracles, yet they did not accept Islam.

43
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,720
They heard the neighing of the horse of Angel Jibraeel in the battle of Badr

44
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,680
but they did not recite the kalimah.

45
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:11,800
On that faithful day, in the 8th year after Hijrah, when he announced that I have forgiven all of you, they all accepted Islam.

46
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:33,040
I humbly plead to the entire Muslim Ummat, that we pray for their guidance and that we do not even think of committing acts of Ignorance, such as attacking a church.

47
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,240
This is not the way of my Nabi. There is no permission for this in Allah’s Qur’an.

48
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:51,600
He has not permitted us to do such things. We have to forgive, and to leave it up to Allah.

49
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,000
When the Abbasid Caliphate had grown weak, Christians attacked the city of Jerusalem and gained control.

50
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:15,480
The leader of the Christians at that time had taken an oath that until Muslim blood reaches the neck of my horse, the slaughter will continue.

51
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Men, women and children were slaughtered, massacred.

52
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Blood flowed in the streets like water.

53
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,320
So terrible it was that a Christian Priest pleaded with the leader to stop the bloodshed, let them be.

54
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:49,520
He replied that until my oath is fulfilled, I will not stop. A bucket of blood was brought and thrown at the horse which covered its chest.

55
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,520
Only then he ended the horrendous massacre. By then, hundreds of thousands of people were killed.

56
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,200
May Allah illuminate the grave of Salahuddin Ayyubi.

57
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,200
When he conquered Jerusalem he announced that everyone was forgiven.

58
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:20,040
Whoever wants to stay here can do so freely, and whoever would like to leave,  , and then take whatever you can with you.

59
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:29,440
Those who want to leave should leave a certain amount as payment in lieu of what they take with them.

60
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Those who could afford to pay this fine did so while those who could not,

61
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:48,080
may I be sacrificed for the character of Salahuddin, their fine was paid from his own personal wealth and deposited in the treasury.

62
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:59,240
When all of the great Christian historians mention these incidents, their pens stop in their tracks out of shame and have no choice

63
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,760
but to openly sing the praises of Salahuddin and denounce the atrocities of their kings.

64
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:15,200
My brothers and sisters,I swear by Allah, we have to hold on firmly to the character of our Nabi.

65
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,400
The real decision will be made by Allah in the next life.

66
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Oppression and hatred are to responded to with oppression and hate.

67
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:31,880
One of the greatest sunnahs of our beloved Nabi is to forgive .

68
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,440
As salaamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuhu.
(peace be onto you)
