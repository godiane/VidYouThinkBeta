there I have always liked still kind of

184
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,260
fear which I thought was awesome by the

185
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,970
way good I want to speak up I know that

186
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,460
like a melon suppose I don't look you

187
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,220
guys to do it but I noticed no price

188
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,740
tags on me just be advised no I did not

189
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,449
feel any of these clothes why not steal

190
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,030
things their clothes or anything like

191
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,639
that so you know these are all this new

192
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,470
and I haven't obviously mortensen yet

193
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,510
for the most part of an unlucky one

194
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,820
because it's bit like brand new so I

195
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,400
haven't touched on surprise myself yet

196
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:08,560
still feel it inside past the hats why

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:10,419
so steel feeling son and this letter is

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,669
actually the last letter that I wasn't a

199
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,099
few guys and I got excited look so cool

200
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:17,320
because this one is just like super cut

201
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:19,240
out like everywhere on it so like yeah

202
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,870
all over it it's just like all these

203
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,660
cutouts like throw on all the pleas of

204
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,180
butter who's even cut up there and I

205
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,370
think on that side to stay fed up yes

206
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,440
there is and then also like all down

207
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,430
there through there and they kind of

208
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,630
just like keep continuing on down it

209
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,520
everywhere and it's good because it like

210
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,159
it's like you're warm but it's also like

211
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,610
style of cut-ups everywhere which is

212
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,720
often so you got this letter is actually

213
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,089
very last thing that I can usually fool

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,769
and we do outfit or usability weird

215
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,600
ideas like whatever you guys follow me

216
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,550
around I don't know I don't really at

217
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,980
least like just refuses I just kind of

218
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,449
like weird but I feel like where you can

219
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,949
really Ruby's like from ever you wanna

220
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:03,660
wear them you've already knows notice

221
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:06,269
right now but I have anything different

222
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,310
on but see you may actually not do exist

223
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,709
that you've actually had all a space net

224
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,750
and soft a different style but I

225
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:14,370
actually soft and i got these are simple

226
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,170
and they're really good because they

227
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,529
just kind of like cling to your leg and

228
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,329
they feel exactly like how fishnet feels

229
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,790
like they feel the same way very much

230
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:27,000
and as we can see sexy what you regard

231
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,339
with great and I was diuretic do so hope

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,339
I don't centrally corner somewhere those

233
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,480
