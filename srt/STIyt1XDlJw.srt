15
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,349
routine kind of video because a lot of

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,079
the time i actually will have a very

17
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,350
very weird sleep schedule and i will

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,610
wake up at like 12 or later sometimes it

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,930
just kind of depends this and that's my

20
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,450
sleep schedule will get like really

21
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,329
crazy anyways okay I'm going to show you

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,489
guys my morning routine now hi guys so

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,550
of course the first thing that I need to

24
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,289
do is wake up though when I wake up I'm

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,390
usually wearing this it's like a hello

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,980
kitty robe so this is usually when I

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,320
sleep in and then when i wake up i'm

28
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,530
usually this cuz that's kind of how that

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,049
works I guess huh so yeah I've awake now

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,640
my bed is not really made that great

31
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,170
right now but I've been in California

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,670
the last few months and now i'm back

33
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,840
here in connecticut for a while so um

34
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,119
when I came up here from there I

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,000
couldn't bring on my bedding so right

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,759
now I have a different bedding so I have

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,159
Pikachu this is pretty new ish oh my

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,960
Pikachu comforter I bad just not made

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,970
that well right now so sorry about that

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,220
I yay for Pikachu I wish I had Pikachu

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,820
pillows deal I feel like that would look

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,439
so much better with this also just

43
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,140
remembered that I spend a ton of time in

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,420
the morning doing this I spend a ton of

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,860
time on my phone here a lot at a time

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,420
when I wake up one of the first things

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,970
that I'll do before I even get out of

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,009
bed is just going my phone and be

49
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,159
checking Twitter Instagram and all of

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,560
that and my emails and youtube comments

51
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,210
and just a bunch of stuff that can be

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,130
pretty addicting being in your phone so

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,770
sometimes I feel like I will just be in

54
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,020
there for like a couple of hours even

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,969
sometimes just like checking stuff next

56
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,160
thing that I do when I wake up this is

57
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,069
one of the first very important things

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,170
that I do is I brush

59
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,389
my teeth everyday hugely I'll come in

60
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,040
here and get a toothbrush my real

61
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,389
toothbrush is actually charging right

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,980
now because it's like an electric one

63
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:20,749
but this is one of my travel

64
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,659
toothbrushes it's not opens right now

65
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:25,579
because it's new but the hello kitty one

66
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:29,090
so it's pretty cool and then I'll brush

67
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:31,370
my teeth every day and um yeah then I'll

68
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,430
go into the bathroom and I'll take a

69
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:40,609
bath or like a shower or whatever huh so

70
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:42,709
yeah yay shower / bathtub um and if i

71
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:45,590
have time to you then I kind of prefer

72
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:49,549
baths a lot because I think bats are

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,169
really nice and relaxing and like when

74
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:53,780
they're warm they're really nice to just

75
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:56,449
like stay in there for a while so yeah

76
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,400
that's the next thing that I'll do then

77
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,900
after that i'll usually go and pick what

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,549
i'm going to wear today this is what I'm

79
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,889
wearing today I'm going to show you

80
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:06,650
closer this is my outfit that I'm

81
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:09,019
wearing today it is kind of like a

82
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,090
two-piece dress skirt thing it's like

83
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,949
white there and then it's just like

84
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,019
green with these cool flowers on it and

85
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:18,079
the coolest thing about this outfit is I

86
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:21,019
actually have Hello Kitty tights huh I

87
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:22,549
love hello kitty so I thought they were

88
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,590
so cool it's like my favorite part of

89
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,299
this so the clothes that i have here

90
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,489
right now are like kind of a mess

91
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,959
because been in California the last

92
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,000

128
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,540
I'll also do my hair so what I'll

129
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,940
usually do with my hair I actually

130
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,970
already have it done right now but what

131
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,980
i'll do is i will straighten it so I

132
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,450
have my straightener right there I don't

133
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,850
actually straighten my hair every day

134
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,800
because I do have pretty naturally

135
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,050
straight hair I always liked my hair to

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,820
be perfectly straight so if sometimes I

137
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,010
feel like it kind of got a little bit

138
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,300
waves or anything as I was sleeping and

139
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,560
I'll just kind of go through it and

140
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,150
straighten it and make sure it's as

141
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,060
straight as I want it to be and then

142
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,240
after that then I tease my hair a little

143
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,630
bit and I use tresemme freeze this is

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,690
the best hairspray ever this one right

145
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,400
here so this is like my favorite

146
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,140
hairspray ever sorry i know i don't have

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,030
the cap on that good the caps are

148
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,880
actually always really hard to get on

149
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,010
these so i don't always even put them

150
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,620
back on but yeah this is my favorite

151
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,990
hairspray it's super super good because

152
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,810
it really really keeps your hair in

153
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,850
place and it does a really good job of

154
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,219
making sure if you have like bangs that

155
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,469
they don't like fall apart pretty much

156
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,630
and what I basically do to my hair is

157
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,400
just straight in it tease it and

158
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,200
hairspray it a little bit and then

159
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,909
sometimes lately i've been using couple

160
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,650
products that i'll show you guys but

161
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,570
yeah that's pretty much what I do but if

162
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,180
you want to see exactly how I do it and

163
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,040
more I guess deaths or whatever then I

164
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,600
do have some hair tutorial videos where

165
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,180
I kind of show you guys how i style it

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,460
and do all that last time that I got my

167
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,070
hair cut it was by my friend Edward

168
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,330
trico me he's really cool so I have to

169
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,980
make up on my hands right now a little

170
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,530
bit huh he was actually nice enough to

171
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,839
give me these two amazing products so

172
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,430
this is an anti frizz finishing cream

173
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,050
and it's super good it's just kind of

174
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,060
like a cream that you just kind of like

175
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,250
squirt this a little bit if you have any

176
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,330
frizziness in your hair or if you feel

177
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,400
like you just kind of need this to keep

178
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,410
your hair in place then you just kind of

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,050
like rub it into your hair a little bit

180
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,490
I get a mirror huh and then yeah like

181
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,560
the whiteness like when you put it on

182
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,480
your hand completely goes away when you

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,279

188
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,579
really good job of doing that and if you

189
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,860

195
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,480
yeah it was a really good job of like

196
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,949
keeping hair that doesn't want to stay

197
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,959
in the right place in the right place so

198
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,970

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,000
hairs like you leaked early so it's a

213
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,579
useful for that this one is just kind of

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,649
like a clear color when you like fun on

215
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,810
your finger and then just kind of like

216
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,250
put in your hair and then you'll notice

217
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,120
your hair is really shiny like when

218
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,100

219
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,050

222
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:45,019
my friends Edward for telling me about

223
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,720
both these products and forgiving them

224
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,980
to me because they're both awesome and

225
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,959
yeah they're called the warren tricomi

226
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,360
style that's the line that they're from

227
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,880
and it's a blow-dry serum and the

228
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,769
anti-frizz finishing cream so yeah these

229
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,870
are both super good and I would really

230
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:03,110
recommend ease by the way guys I'm not

231
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:07,209
sure if my wing on my left eye was a bit

232
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:09,709
off today so if it was that I'm sorry

233
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,689
usually I don't think I have the hardest

234
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:13,910
time doing a wing some people always

235
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:16,490
tell me like wow your makeup is so bad

236
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,110
but I don't know I do it every day so I

237
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,199
don't think it's usually too off but

238
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,199
sometimes obviously it can be a little

239
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:26,150
bit off so hopefully it's not too bad ok

240
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,100
