1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,200
I used to believe

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,680
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,840
Somethin' beautiful

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,120
Selling a dream

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,580
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,580
On a miracle

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,140
Say, go through the darkest of days

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,200
Heaven's a heartbreak away

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,920
Never let you go, never let me down

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,920
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,140
Never let you go, never let me down

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,080
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,060
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,800
Let me love you
Let me love you

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,640
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,300
Let me love you
Let me love you
