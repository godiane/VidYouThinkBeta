video we are all too familiar with

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,140
design but ever wonder why what makes a

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,320
good design what makes it attractive

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,960
what makes it likely what makes a good

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,610
design work it turns out there's a

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,980
science behind it there are a lot of

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,280
principles that designers obey or

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,040
sometimes creatively disobey to create a

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,100
good design one principle designers use

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,770
is dis talk theory on the Year eighteen

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,860
ninety is tall is a term coined by

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,350
Austin philosopher christian von erin

Kostka created the principles it

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,150
describes the science and how do we

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,310
perceive things visually especially when

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,500
the parts relate to the cool and modern

solving psychology therapy and

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,979
especially on visual design you saw fear

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,159
when a fine to visual designs has six

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,369
main principles first similarity

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,220
principle it happens what objects look

33
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,060
similar to one another viewers will

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,270
often see individual elements as part of

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,240
a pattern or group this effect can be

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,119
used to create single illustration image

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,030
or message from a series of separate

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,180
elements next there is common fate or

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,280
continually we perceive moving objects

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,590
in the scene directions as related to

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,110
each other more so than the elements

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,440
that are stationary or appear to be

43
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,210
moving in the different direction then

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,150
closure

45
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:17,030
this works when an object is incomplete

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,310
or the interior space of an element is

47
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,860
not fully closed but the viewer

48
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,490
perceives a complete shape by filling

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,040
out the missing information proximity

50
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,630
uses the closed arrangement or distance

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,500
of elements to create a group

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,820
association between those objects if

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,220
individual elements are also similar

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,080
they will tend to be perceived as a

55
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,460
single cool even though they are

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,040
separate elements next is pronounced

57
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:48,680
meaning figure and brown it often uses

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,530
the idea of light and shade to help

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,160
create an image that jumps out from the

60
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,980
series of shapes lastly symmetry as you

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,890
probably know we perceive objects are

62
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,030
made out of two complementary halves

63
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,740
this is where balance and harmony all of

64
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,080
these gestalt principles are

65
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,170
scientifically studied ways on how we

66
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,540
perceive visually designers use or

67
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,000
totally disregard this principle in

68
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,250
order to make their design unique but as

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,580
we all know being unique might sometimes

70
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,710
be quirky or uncool nevertheless the

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,290
next time you see a design see how many

72
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:31,120
principles can you spot and appreciate

73
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,120
the word behind a good design
